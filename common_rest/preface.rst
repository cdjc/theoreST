**Who is Jesus Christ?**

Professor Simon Greenleaf was one of the most eminent lawyers of all time. His “Laws of Evidence” for many years were accepted by all States in the United States as the standard methodology for evaluating cases. He was teaching law at a university in the United States when one of his students asked Professor Greenleaf if he would apply his “Laws of Evidence” to evaluate an historical figure. When Greenleaf agreed to the project he asked the student who was to be the subject of the review. The student replied that the person to be examined would be Jesus Christ. Professor Greenleaf agreed to undertake the examination of Jesus Christ and as a result, when he had finished the review, Simon Greenleaf personally accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as his Saviour.

Professor Greenleaf then sent an open letter to all jurists in the United States jurists saying in part “I personally have investigated one called Jesus Christ. I have found the evidence concerning him to be historically accurate. I have also discovered that Jesus Christ is more than a human being, he is either God or nothing and having examined the evidence it is impossible to conclude other than he is God. Having concluded that he is God I have accepted him as my personal Saviour. I urge all members of the legal profession to use the “Laws of Evidence” to investigate the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and if you find that he is wrong expose him as a faker but if not consider him as your Saviour and Lord”

    The two paragraphs about Simon Greenleaf appear to contain mostly apocryphal (though oft repeated) information. Besides, the 'appeal to authority' argument is not appropriate here - we should be describing who Jesus is, not who some vague old guy we've never heard of thinks he is. In answering the question "Who is Jesus" we don't need a story, but perhaps a more concise definition, and even challenging and confronting us with the choice we all have to make about what we will do with the knowledge of who Jesus is.

**How can I be saved?**

*Salvation is available for all members of the human race.*
Salvation is the most important undertaking in all of God's universe. The salvation of sinners is never on the basis of God's merely passing over or closing His eyes to sin. God saves sinners on a completely righteous basis consistent with the divine holiness of His character. This is called grace. It relies on God so man cannot work for salvation neither can he deserve it. We need to realise that the creation of this vast unmeasured universe was far less an undertaking than the working out of God's plan to save sinners.

However the acceptance of God's salvation by the sinner is the most simple thing in all of life. One need not be rich, nor wise nor educated. Age is no barrier nor the colour of one's skin. The reception of the enormous benefits of God's redemption is based upon the simplest of terms so that there is no one in all this wide universe who need be turned away.

**How do I become a Christian?**

There is but one simple step divided into three parts. First of all I have to recognise that I am a sinner (`Romans 3:23; 6:23; Ezekiel 18:4; John 5:24`).

Secondly, realising that if I want a relationship with Almighty God who is perfect, and recognising that I am not perfect, I need to look to the Lord Jesus Christ as the only Saviour (`1 Corinthians 15:3; 1 Peter 2:24; Isaiah 53:6; John 3:16`).

Thirdly, by the exercise of my own free will I personally receive the Lord Jesus Christ as my Saviour, believing that He died personally for me and that He is what He claims to be in an individual, personal and living way (`John 1:12; 3:36; Acts 16:31; 4:12`).

**The results of Salvation**

The results of this are unbelievably wonderful:
My sins are taken away (`John 1:29`),
I possess eternal life now (`1 John 5:11,12`),
I become a new creature in Christ (`2 Corinthians 5:17`),
The Holy Spirit takes up His residence in my life (`1 Corinthians 6:19`),
And I will never perish (`John 10:28-30`).

This truthfully is life's greatest transaction. This is the goal of all people; this is the ultimate of our existence. We invite and exhort any reader who has not become a Christian by trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ to follow these simple instructions and be born again eternally into God's family (`Matthew 11:28; John 1:12; Acts 4:12; 16:31`).
