Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Men are indeed saved to serve, and one of the best ways of discovering the true value of any new theology is to test it in active evangelism." (Green, 1968, page 186).

Verses 22-23  - On some who appear to be apostates, have compassion at first, using discernment, and deal with their wavering by stabilising them in the sure Word Of God. Some people are dangerous in this category, and we approach all work with possible apostates, with fear and caution, but we must be compassionate having pity for them and their fate, if they stay in error. Spend some time with them. You will win some but you may lose most.   

In order to do this you need to be walking closely with the Lord and be constantly looking to the reality of the Lord coming and living in the reality of his soon coming and his holy Word. Even though you are going to be strong spiritually you are still to be careful of those you are dealing with. In this case you are snatching the brands from the flames, and the slightest inattention and you will get burnt. You do not leave your hand in the fire. It is not done in a casual manner.  You look upon the evil that they are involved with as fire, you respect it. If you are going to help them, do so, but do not get other people or yourself, into danger. For example, if you know that someone is living in sexual sin you do not go and see them alone.

Garments soiled with the flesh, is a phrase that refers to anything associated with the O.S.N. and such things must be hated and rejected, as if infected with the plague. If you are not disgusted about everything involving the O.S.N. you are in danger. Jude has given us in this letter warnings about evil in the church that we may help those who are trapped in it, but we must not get mesmerised by the "nice" things about evil practises; they are to be hated!     

"Mercy must not become a snare luring the orthodox into the falsehood of those he is trying to help."  (Sidebottom, 1982, page 93). Clothing can carry some influences with it, as is clear from `Mark 5:27-30,  Acts 19:11`. In these cases the influence is good, but it may be bad also, and we must not be complacent about any things associated with evil.

Verse 24-25  - These verses are a song of praise and confidence and now within the church, a favourite benediction. He is reminding everybody that they are on the winning team. God has kept you, is keeping you and will keep you through to glory. You are in the Lord's hands. He will give the glory and get the glory.  

"To him who is able.This is what gives new strength to the wearied warrior. Weak and helpless in himself, he looks up in the faith to one who is able and thus out of weakness is made strong.   And as he has all needed stores of grace for the pilgrim path, so the end is sure."  (Ironside, 1983, page 58, 59).

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Anything associated with evil is to be hated. This is strong and not often applied today, which is why we have so many believers being led astray by the very people they try to help. We must hate sin with all our being. If we do not, we do not have the Lord's viewpoint and we are standing into danger.  

We have faced the reality of evil in the church, we have seen the apostates, we know we are going to have fights on our hands and will be under pressure but we know what we have to do we need to be strong in the Lord. 

We can be concerned to win some of them if possible to the Lord and always remember that God is in control and that we are on the winning side. He is able to keep us and bring us through to glory.

When you are facing an apostate in the church you must remember that you are on the winning side. Be strong in the Lord, trust Him, claim this promise, the Lord is able to carry you through. Carefulness and praise go together; we praise and worship God and we guard ourselves with doctrine against the evil ones.
