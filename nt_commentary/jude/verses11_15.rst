Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Strictly speaking there are but two religions in the world; the true, that is, of God's appointing, and the false, the product of man's own mind." (Ironside, 1983, page 31)

Verse 11  - Jude refers to three apostates, Cain, Balaam and Korah. Each one gives you an insight into the motivation of the apostate. These three think they can do things their way and impress God but they are following their own lusts. The three give us the insight into God's standards, and our own sinful natures.   Cain had lust to power, and lacked love and affection. Balaam had lust for money, and lacked devotion to the will of God and the Lord's truth. Korah had power lust, a spirit of rebellion against the legitimate authority set up by God for the government of Israel.  

Each man is a good study of rebellion; they provide a three sided portrait of apostates so that we may better spot them in advance. Ironside refers to, "the unholy trinity of Apostasy. The way of Cain is false religion.  The error of Balaam is false ministry. The gain saying of Korah is false worship and rebellion against Christ's authority." (1983, page 37)

The key to understanding apostasy is to see its twin root; pride and lust. Apostasy, at its heart, is the belief by a mere mortal that they can, "do great things for God" , that they, in their own human strength, are able to impress God by their deeds. True faith, on the other hand, is identified by the belief, behaviour, and attitude of grace, humility and Holy Spirit empowered service, for the true believer realises that they are, by themselves, incapable of pleasing God in anything. Let us examine each of these three men that Jude selects as examples of apostates.

Cain - Genesis 4  - Cain is the religious apostate who rejected the necessity of the blood sacrifice and probably is the best representation of the liberal minister nowadays. Cain did not believe that man was a sinner in need of a Saviour and stressed that man was created in the image of God, and could bring to God the fruit of his own work and be accepted.   He believed that he was only one generation away from God, and therefore accepted in and of himself, through his relationship with Adam. God does not have grand-children, nor does he accept us in the creation as anything more than "fallen creatures".     

Cain found the whole concept of the "fall" and sin repugnant. He felt that the blood sacrifice was uncouth and felt superior to his brother Abel and that the work of his own hands would be acceptable to God. Cain was an exponent of natural religion, rather than revealed religion. He stands as an example of, human good, rather than divine good, man's works rather than God's work. 

Liberals today teach the goodness of man and that we just need to be made a little nicer. Cain brought his offering in a sincere manner, within his false religious belief system, thanking God that he had been made so nice and that he had been able to produce all these good things from the ground. It was therefore a thanks offering but in God's Word you do not bring a thanks offering before you bring a sin offering as you are not worthy to bring anything to God unless you have brought a sacrifice for sin. 

Cain therefore rejected the notion of a sin barrier between God and man. He was sincere, but he was sincerely wrong! Many people today think that all that is required is sincerity; this is false. What God demands of us is truth and obedience to his revealed standards.

In liberal colleges they talk about the God of all nations, the universal fatherhood of God, and the brotherhood of all mankind. They do not accept the sinfulness of all men and just try to be nice. They consider that God is just a good father in the sky who will pat us all on the head in the end saying that we did well. We tried and in the end, that is what matters. This view is evil and wrong. Cain was a nice fellow until he was convicted of his wrongdoing. Then in the murder of his brother we see what evil will do to a man who fools himself that he is O K.  

A good example of this today are pacifists who will march against war and violence, but if they are resisted become the most violent and angry people you could ever meet. A pacifist will almost kill you if you oppose them as a military officer. 

When God convicted Cain of sin his anger came out together with bitterness and hatred towards his brother. He said to God, in effect that, if he wanted a blood sacrifice he would provide one in the form of his brother Abel who he proceeded to kill by cutting his throat with a sacrificial knife. Liberalism looks nice but when faced with the truth its true nature will jump out. "In Jewish tradition Cain had become the type of self seeking men as well as of sceptics who refused to believe in any moral retribution or in the afterlife."  (Moffatt, 1963, page 238).

The second apostate mentioned is Balaam - Numbers Chapters 22-25 - where he is shown as a money hungry religious man. He knew enough about God to know that God was morally pure, but he tried to push the line of what was permissible, to try to earn money as well. He tried to use his spiritual knowledge to gain money by getting Israel cursed. He finally knew he couldn't curse Israel, but he knew that if they were tempted into sexual immorality then they would come under the curse of God. He therefore advised the enemy as to the strategy that would lead to Israel being judged by God, while apparently keeping his hands "clean".   He was a pious fraud; preaching holiness but counselling immorality and making money from it as a prostitute's pimp would.

Balaam knew some doctrine but did not understand the nature of God's grace and the action of this graciousness regarding His own. If a person pushes holiness but does not portray grace in their life or talk about it you may be looking at a religious apostate. Many people will use the subject of holiness for their own ends. There are people who can talk about holiness and make you think they are saints yet they are living immoral lives, or helping others to hell by their counsel.

The second thing he did not know was his position before God. First of all he tried to curse Israel but God would not allow him. He then gave Balak some advice to the effect that if you want to destroy Israel you have to separate them from God's blessing and put them under the sin unto death and then God will do it for you. He told Balak to send his most beautiful women to seduce the young men of Israel. After that they should be invited down to the temple to worship the pagan gods. 

By immorality you compromise the man and you follow this with religious idolatry. God will then deal with Israel. God does not like immorality or religious apostasy. For this information Balaam received a fortune and for a while it worked until Phineas got to work with his javelin and Balaam died. Balaam knew the truth but the truth did not get to know him.  He made money out of spiritual things, to "consume it upon his lusts", (James 4 : 3), and there are still people in the church nowadays who use their faith for money making purposes, for selfish lustful reasons.

The third person was Korah who had two friends/relatives Dathan and Abiram  Korah was a power hungry religious apostate.   In your ministry you will meet all three of Satan's men. 

Korah was the type of person who wants the pastor at his beck and call. There is no spirituality their only desire is for power or lust. Korah pushed Moses and Aaron aside and then started ministering in worship.   He seized the office of priest which was not his and he was judged by God. 

There is always a danger that a person will usurp a position that the Lord has not given him. All this type of apostate think that they are God's gift to the church.   

He was disqualified from leadership under the first letter of John because he has no love for the brethren. 1 John 3:11-24, 4:6-13. Also, refer John 13:15-16. A servant attitude is required for a person to hold a position in a local church. 1 Peter 5:6. If God wants you in a position He will raise you up, do not politic for votes. Satan's people tend to push for positions. If someone is pushing for a position it is usually a good indication that they should not get it. Recognise them, identify them and deal with them.

Verse  12 - This describes apostates in the church or believers in a continuously carnal state. "To the heavenly calling they are strangers, hence their aim and object is to advance their own interests in this world." (Ironside, 1983, page 39). 

The love feast was an agape meal held in conjunction with the communion service. For the evening service they would meet as a church and have a shared meal first in the ancient world. They met after breakfast at 5 in the morning (as Sunday was not a day of rest in the Roman Empire) and they would worship before they went to work. But after dark they would gather for a longer service, and they would have a love feast with the members of the church gathering the food together and sharing a meal together. After the agape they would have a communion service followed by a teaching service. 

The apostates would be there for the evening service; wherever there is free food and fellowship these people love to gather. The Greek word used to describe them is "spilos" meaning spots. This is a hidden shoal of rocks close to the shore that a boat will strike and sink. You are just about at the shore when you hit the rocks, you are saved but you suffer great loss to all your cargo on your ship. 

This is what apostates do in the church. 2 Peter 2:13. They cannot affect the salvation of the believer but they can rob them of eternal rewards by shipwrecking their lives and witness. They rob people of eternal reward by side tracking them from their legitimate service and destroy the spirituality of those who are influenced by them.

They are said to have no fear, that is, they have no respect for God or His Word, no fear of judgement, and they reject the authority of anyone other than themselves.

The third thing that is said of them, is that they are like a cloud without water, they look good from the distance, as if they will bring needed rain, but they have nothing in them. They look and speak well but they have no substance. They promise great things but produce nothing.

The fourth thing that describes them is that they are trees whose fruit has withered, and come to nothing. Literally it is a tree in autumn, but rather than being fruitful it has withered and has no fruit. From a distance it looks as if it has something on it but there is no fruit, or bad wizened up fruit, once you arrive. These apostates are like that; they are both sterile and useless.  They will not only not satisfy you and will let you down, but will also cause you to get a disease if you eat what they produce.   

Like the poor vines in John 15, they will be torn up by the roots, and burned, with no trace of them left and they will be placed in the Lake of Fire. As a minister, facing these people, you have to hang in there under the pressures they will bring upon you, for in the end these people will be plucked up by the roots. Compare this passage with 1 Corinthians 11:20-22, Matthew 3:10, 7:19, 13:29, 15:13, Luke 13:6-9, John 15:2-6, 2 Peter 1:8, 2 Peter 2:13 -17.

In Proverbs 25:14, such people are described as, those who boast of gifts that they fail to give, being like clouds and wind without rain. The true believer is always a "refreshment" to all they meet, the false brethren are shown to be false by their lack of production of anything other than confusion.   

Verse 13 -  Eternally you are secure, but as "make believers", they are not. You have a place in heaven, due to your position in Christ, they have a place in hell, due to their following of Satan's policies. 

Even though they appear to be winning now, they will lose in eternity. "To the heavenly calling they are strangers; hence their aim and object is to advance their won interests in this world." (Ironside, 1983, page 39) 

They are full of sound and fury, but they signify nothing! They look powerful and mighty, but it is earthly power and earthly wisdom and it has no significance against the power and majesty of God. Even though they behave as if they are a big raging wave of the sea, they will hit the rock, and you are on the rock. They will be foam on the beach, and like waves in a storm, cause destruction to all who are exposed on the beach, and also they will carry all the flotsam and jetsam of the sea. 

The picture Jude uses is of a garbage filled wave spewing its rotten seaweed onto the beach, or against the rock. They are full of shameful things; their lives contain many disgusting evils. Just as you don't see what is in a wave until it breaks over a rock or upon a beach, just so with these people. It is only as they break on the rock that you see what was in them all along, and they are full of garbage!

Verse 14  - This is a quote from the apocryphal book of Enoch which is not part of Scripture. The fact that Jude quotes this part shows us that the book of Enoch records this accurately, but does not mean that the book is canonical, or correct in any other part of it. Jude' s message(as Enoch's was) is, God is coming to judge and will end all apostasy. These evil ones will be dealt with and swept away. God is in control, and he will judge the evil, but if they are still active, it simply means that he hasn't moved against them yet!   

We must claim Romans 8:28, in such situations, and look for the good that can come as we confront evil directly. The debates about the validity of quoting Enoch fill many commentaries. Ironside's point is a good one regarding these commentaries. "The source of Jude's information as to this prophecy is not given.   Criticism has busied itself to find out, but all to little purpose and certainly to no profit." (Ironside, 1983, page 44).

Verse 15 - These people are ungodly in all their ways, both immoral and anti-God in their beliefs and practises. Four times Jude uses the word for ungodly, to underline the evil of these people and the certainty of the Lord's visiting judgement on them. All they say and do will be visited upon them.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Like the apostates of Jude's day the apostates of our own need to be identified quickly and dealt with promptly. "Like Cain they were devoid of love. Like Balaam they were prepared in return for money to teach others that sin did not matter. Like Korah they were careless of the ordinances of God and insubordinate to church leaders." (Green, 1968, page 173). Once we spot such people we need to deal with them by thorough church discipline.

Do we train our fellow believers to put on their armour against such people? Do we take their threat seriously, or do we let them stay within the church and hurt the weak? Paul tells us as firmly, as Jude does, Ephesians 6 - the whole armour of God must be put on, for only it will allow us to stand against the wiles of the devil, and his people.  We stand on the rock and we must stand well armed against the attacks of these evil people.

Believers must be warned about and against these evil people, and from the pulpit they should be identified and dealt with. Vigilance is the price of our Christian freedom, and we are to stand firm against all who would rob believers of their hope.
