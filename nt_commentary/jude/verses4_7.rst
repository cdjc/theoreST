Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"It has ever been the object of Satan to secretly introduce evil workers into the assemblies of the saints of God, that thus the simple and the unwary may be deceived and led astray."  (Ironside, 1983, page 16).

Jude had to write to counter the threat of spiritual saboteurs, spies and terrorists who had crept into the churches and were undermining the faith of believers from within the church itself. All such people are condemned by the Lord as far back as `Deuteronomy 13:1-11`, where severe judgement is spelled out for all who lead others from the truth. Jude reminds the people of his day and ours that the Bible has many examples of the Lord's judgement upon these evil ones and we are to remember these and take warning from them. He reminds them, and us, of three great apostasies; the angels, the Israelites and the pagans of the cities of the Plain. To protect ourselves we must hold onto the truth of the gospel message.

We are not followers of a martyr or a hero who died on the cross, we are servants of the risen Lord Jesus Christ, the king of kings and Lord of Lords. The crucifixion must always be looked at in the light of the resurrection, and the two spoken of together, for we serve a victorious Saviour. It is not where you were born or who your parents are it is whether you are born again that matters eternally.

We have to remember the tremendous riches we have in Christ Jesus, for these evil people will try to rob us of our heritage in Christ. It is because we have this position in Christ that Satan hates us so much and is involved in infiltrating and undermining local congregations, doctrinally, organisationally and any other way he can. Satan hates you! He knows he is doomed, and he hates you because you are saved! He wants to create misery for you, and this is why he attacks believers so much; he cannot stand a happy and stable Christian.

Jude talks about the tactics that Satan uses to destroy churches. Satan does not want any of the believers to enjoy the position we have in Christ Jesus. When a person believes and is saved, Satan recognises that he has lost them and that they are not going to spend eternity in the lake of fire with him, but he is going to try and give them as much fire as possible while they are here so that they do not enjoy their position in Christ.

When a believer is out of fellowship he is susceptible to Satanic attack. After they were saved, like the seed of the sower in the Lord's parable, the brambles, of sin and worldliness, have grown up around them and they were choked. Part of the job of the pastor is to use the sword of the Spirit to cut down the brambles but the person concerned also has to do the weeding. When someone is saved the battle has not been won completely. You must redouble your efforts with them to bring them through to spiritual maturity thus bringing them through the next section of satanic attack that will come upon them, and warning them to stay alert.

The cause of the fall of most churches and believers into sin, or spiritual uselessness, is found in this book.

Verse 4  - The people who came in unawares came in by the side door. John 10:1-9, is the passage that Jude is referring to here. The Lord says that those who come in other than through the door (himself) are thieves and evil men come to kill the sheep. 

The Greek word here is, "pareisdouomai", and is the aorist active indicative. This means, aorist tense, they came in at different points of time, and this is a reality in the church and always will be. They have crept in to stir people up. `John 10:10` says that the purpose that Jesus Christ  came was that all who believe in him might have life and have it more abundantly.  

All who come through the true door of salvation have that life, but these people don't; they are not there to enjoy life in Christ but to eat and molest sheep! They are in the church but they have not come through the door, they have not come through Christ, they are not genuine believers at all, they are make believers. They are the wolves and the Lord's words over them are words of judgement and condemnation. We should be as tough as the Lord is over those who enter the church for any other reason than to serve and love him.

There are two passages that come to mind in relation to this verse of Jude. The first is 2 Corinthians 11:13-15. Paul pictures these false people as masquerading as followers of Christ, but they are deceitful; they are of Satan, who is able to change into an angel of light. These people, Paul says are not going to come into the church with horns on their heads, tails and carrying a trident. This is the Greek god Pan and not the Satan of the Bible. We must be careful we do not follow the Hollywood version of the devil rather than the Biblical one. He is the most beautiful creature that God ever created, he looks good and sounds good, he is not an ugly troll. He is beauty personified and that is the evil of him.

The second passage is, 2 Timothy 3:1-6 , here Paul notes that these people look religious but deny the true spiritual power of living faith. These are deceitful people, from these people turn away. They have a form of  godliness but have no relationship with God. Behind closed doors their lives are different altogether. These people zero in on women who have unhappy relationships at home which is probably more than 50% of all men and women. If a man is evil he can exploit the unhappiness of another's wife very effectively. Their ungodliness is rooted in their rejection of the authority and guidance of God in all matters; they act independently and in opposition to God's revealed plan and will.

This is very much a part of the present church scene and this should not surprise you. God forewarned us - "prographo" - He has written before - He has revealed this in His Word many times. We should not judge others but we must be fruit inspectors, you shall know them by their fruit. You therefore have to look at the lives of the people that you are dealing with. 

If you have people in the congregation whose lives are not measuring up there are two possibilities. You are not teaching as you should be teaching or they are resisting the Holy Spirit which in itself has two reasons - the person is out of fellowship and needs conviction of sin which the Holy Spirit will bring upon him or he is not a believer. If he is an unbeliever he may be one of Satan's men in the church and needs to be removed either on his own accord or by you removing him or you evangelise him and get everyone to pray for him.

Check your sheep and if you smell a wolf trust your intuitions, check that there is no wolf in sheep clothing. The men are "asebeis" ungodly - they do not think about God or see him as important in their life even though they talk about Him. At  the church social or get together, speak to your sheep in a spiritual manner and in that way sniff out the wolves in the congregation, they are the ones who do not speak or think of spiritual things in a true manner.   

You are also able to look at your sick sheep when you talk about the Lord. Irrespective of how large your congregation is you will have some of them. Make sure that they do no damage by turning the grace of God into lasciviousness. Here we have sexual sins in view. Just because we are not under the Mosaic law it  does not mean that we do not have standards, we are under the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.    

If their life is under the control of the Holy Spirit their life will be holy. If a person is going to be an elder or a deacon he must be well spoken of by unbelievers, for unbelievers will spot a phoney even faster than many believers! Take notice of Paul's words in Timothy and Titus; you can legitimately check out the candidate for deacon and pastor with his unbelieving workmates. If they are immoral secretly it will come out in error doctrinally as well; an immoral life will lead to doctrinal error soon enough, if it wasn't based in it to start with.   Any life out of control, based on gratifying sexual or other sensual needs is a life that is not controlled by the Holy Spirit. Any such person must be challenged in the church, never ignored. For they are either a wayward sheep in need of care and order, or they are a wolf and they will soon strike and lead others astray after them for their own selfish pleasures.

The most evil thing is to pervert something good, and that is what they do, they pervert Grace into immorality. Satan hates the doctrine of God's Grace, for it reminds him of the terrible unforgivable nature of his sin against the love and grace of God. His people, like him, will use grace to cover their sinful lives, claiming they are "forgiven", when the Word of God labels them as "condemned". 

These people claim to be Christians, yet their lives are immoral, by their claim they abuse those who stand for true grace, and thereby bring the very doctrine and the gospel itself into disrepute.   Moral and upright unbelievers who see these libertines are disgusted with their behaviour and associate it with Christianity, and thereby harden their hearts against the gospel that would save them.     

Satan wins a victory by such a strategy, as every time a false view of the gospel is portrayed before men, it becomes harder to give the truth. This is why these false brethren, these wolves in sheep's clothing, must be thoroughly exposed, publicly called evil, and all men and women warned against them as perverters of the truth. Unless they repent and their lives demonstrate the change, the church must expel all whose lives are immoral, lest a false message be given about the nature of the gospel and people are led into confusion about God's holy standards.   Note 4.

Such people, once they have gained a foothold in the church will start to deny the absolute Lordship and saviourhood of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are clever, wily and devious like their master, and so they do not directly reject the Lord, but they place others along side him, and say that there are many ways to heaven, many lords and many gospels, many like Jesus, and we should be open to others views. 

The preach the "spirit of tolerance", but the lie, for in this matter there can be no tolerance, for to be in error on this matter is to be lost forever! This shows they are Satan's people for their views imperil the gospel message and lead people to hell.

Jude is aware of the shock that is going to happen to those who read this. He says that you once knew these things but you have forgotten, you have become lax in your thinking. When you have been in a good church for a number of years you can relax too much and your guard comes down, and you no longer stand for the truth of God's word and compromise on holiness brings evil results. He is now going to give some examples, so we can see how God intends us to apply these principles.

Verse 5  - The first incident Jude draws on is a Jewish one (appropriate for his Jewish readers), it is the rebellion of Israel at Kadesh - barnea in the Exodus. The story is told in Numbers 14. The Jews sent spies into the land whereas they were told to go in themselves. Ten of the twelve spies came back with panic, two with the Word of God and the people panicked, they stopped trusting God and got their eyes on giants, they fell into fear and they all died under God's judgement. They were all believers but they panicked. 

The message from the Lord is clear. Whatever is not of faith is sin! - Romans 14:23. The people perished because they refused to believe the word of the Lord and obey his commands. The sin of unbelief is a serious one; if God says trust and obey, he means, you can trust him and you must obey his word!

One of the first lessons we should learn as believers is that we can fall into apostasy; apostasy is simply falling into unbelief and leaving the path of God and going astray into alternatives. Such a path is dangerous and may lead to ultimate punishment. The ten spies who brought back bad reports died immediately and the people that listened to them all died over the next forty years. Jude therefore shows how important it is to deal with apostates, and reject apostasy. God will not tolerate faithlessness. If you allow apostasy in the church you will have maximum discipline. This is probably why ministers have the greatest numbers of breakdowns as they are under maximum divine discipline.

Verse 6 - Here we go to Genesis 6, and 2 Peter 2:4, which gives the main reason for the flood. Satan sent demons to the earth to seduce human beings and by sex between the two groups destroying true humanity. God stopped this with the flood, saving the one family not contaminated, and believing his word. Here demons fooled people in the area of sex. Sexual sin and sexual temptation are still areas where Satan uses to destroy and undermine believers. Set your guard against temptation in this area.   Note 5.   

Verse 7 - Homosexuality, bestiality and child abuse (all covered by the word ekpornea) - these are evils and Jude makes clear here are a satanic operation - people involved in this area are involved in evil. God is against such things and the judgement of God is against such people, if they reject the gospel of salvation, and persist in their immoral practises. 

In 1 Corinthians 5 where a believer was having an incestuous relationship with his mother the church was not taking it seriously enough. On Paul's instruction he was thrown out of the church and was not allowed back until he had dealt with that sin. In 2 Corinthians he was back in the church as a repentant and changed man. 

Homosexuality is going after, "other flesh", and like the men and women who had sex with demons before the flood, crossing God's boundaries for sex is forbidden. Men are made for sex with women and visa versa;   we were not made for sex with the same sex or with other creatures like angelic beings. To reject God's created plan is to insult God and reject his way and go after the way of Satan; to do this you have joined the enemies camp and will receive the judgement of all who reject the Lord and side with Satan.   

Homosexuals should be told that they will be allowed back into the church once they have recognised their sin and repented from it. If they started practising it again they were ejected because the church must have God's standard. 

If the church lowers its standard the church no longer has a message. By calling homosexuality a disease or an inherited genetic defect, we deprive the homosexual of all hope. Immoral acts are sins that can be forgiven in Christ, and through the working of the Holy Spirit the old, sinful way of life can be abandoned and a new one established (Isaiah I:18; 1 John 1:7; 1 Corinthians 6:9,11). God's answer to sexual immorality is in (1 Corinthians 7:1-9).

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Beware of infiltrators! How seriously we need to take this warning, for the more active we are for the truth the more vehement will be Satan's attempts to plant his people in the church to undermine it from within. Audit your congregation, and act on any reported unholiness that brings the Lord's name into disgrace.

Sexual immorality is always evil, and tends to be an indication of a person who has strayed far from the truth before they fell into the sexual sin. Homosexuality is just one sexual perversion, alongside all others; they are all condemned because they insult God's plan which puts a boundary for sex against such practises. The sin of disobedience is the one that leads to the others, and so Satan can use the foolish believer who strays away from the path, but he also uses his own people here, and they are most dangerous. Any hint of the denial of the only saviourhood of the Lord, and his unique position and Lord of Lords must be investigated and acted upon.  Such people will destroy the faith of many if left in the assembly.

God judges immorality and all who claim to be his and yet reject his words. All unnatural acts are evil. They are defined as such because they violate the plan and purpose of God as he laid out as the creator. Any rejection of God's plan for man, as spelt out in the scriptures is evil; such rebellion against the clear policy of God places such a rebel in the company of the fallen angels, the condemned Israelites, and the people of Sodom. God has standards and they are not changeable; we stand for the truth and it does not change.

Ask yourself believer.  Do you have protocols for behaviour that keep you safe from sexual immorality? Do you place yourself in situations where you may be in temptations way? We are challenged by this passage to keep ourselves safe. This may mean you do not have any private fellowship with members of the opposite sex lest you be tempted or others led astray by your example. Many men and women fall into sexual temptation after business lunches; this ought not to happen!
