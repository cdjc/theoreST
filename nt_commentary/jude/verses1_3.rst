Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verse 1 - This verse brings us face to face with God, Jude sums up the activity of the Godhead that led to our salvation. We are reminded immediately we open this letter that we must be sure of our place as believers, our position in Christ and our calling. Jude is a fundamentalist, this is the fundamentalist epistle; he stands upon the apostolic foundation of historic Christianity. 

Jude tells us to stand here also, to stand in the truth that the early church received from the Holy Spirit, and not to compromise the truth in any way. The foundation of assurance is surety in our knowledge of the stability of the character of God; the Lord is stable in all the characteristics of his nature. He is always, Lord of all, just, righteous, truthful, loving, gracious, full of mercy, all powerful, all knowing, and unchanging; and our salvation depends on his nature not the strength of our faith. `Matthew 17:20`.

Even though he is the half brother of the Lord Jesus Christ he did not claim anything special because of his  relationship, instead he claims servant hood to the risen Lord. It was the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ which convinced James and Jude of his Messiahship, and they were humbled by their salvation, and bowed before his Lordship. Their physical relationship through Mary was a matter of no consequence to them for they saw that the Lord has no "relatives", only sons and daughters in his grace and through personal faith. He is humble, he is devoted to his Lord, so should we be! Too many believers today get familiar with the Lord. This is a verse, with `James 1: 1`, that reminds us to be respectful and humble, he is our Lord and our God, and we are sons and daughters under his authority, and must not speak and act arrogantly.

As a servant he classifies himself, like Paul, as a "doulos" or bond slave. There were different classifications of slaves such as the school teaching slave, the tutor and governor as indicated in Galatians. They had responsibilities and certain privileges even though they were slaves or servants but the bond slave had none being available to his master at any time until his death. In addition there was no chance of him being set free. If you are a minister of the Word of God you are a "doulos" for Christ. This is a positive thing however, for we live here to serve, our reward and true position will only be seen in heaven.

They were sanctified by the Father, preserved by the Lord Jesus Christ and called by the Holy Spirit. Instead of the word sanctified most manuscripts have the word loved by the Father. This word incorporates  sanctification and could best be translated as constantly loved and  sanctified; which ever manuscript reading is correct the  meaning is the same, we are loved and saved by the plan and work of God for us. 

We are the recipients off God's love and God's gracious work. We are made something new, becoming permanently objects of our Father's love. Knowledge of the perfect  love that God has for us, casts out all fears for our safety and eternal security. Most commentators believe that the original word was the perfect passive participle of "agapao", and this underlines God's character, plan  and provision for us.

Preserved is the present passive participle of "tereo" which is a military word meaning guarded or garrisoned by God.  The perfect tense, like that of agapao, shows action in the past that continues forever, passive voice, we receive it. Both of these concepts are summed up in the 23rd Psalm. God's Character is on the line. If God lost us he loses His absolute character. You are perfectly the recipient of God's love. You are called and those He calls He keeps. 

We are set upon the rock, our position is secure. Every cult tries to undermine  believers at this point. On verses like these we stand for the doctrine of "Eternal Security", or as the old Calvinistic theologians called it, "The perseverance of the Saints", and as one wag put it, the "eternal insecurity of the aints". Arminianism, with its doctrinal position that you can lose your salvation, gives you an insecure faith which then leads to emotional swings. Jude says remember your position in Christ, and be stabilised. He  cares for you - `1 Peter 5:7`, you are kept by his power not your own,  `John  6:47, 65`, 

Verse 2  -  Jude uses the optative mood here which is a mood reflecting his wish or  desire for the believers. He wants three things to be multiplied in the believers' lives; mercy,  peace and love. "If mercy, peace and love are ever lacking it bespeaks not a stinted supply of grace, but a failure to enter into what is freely bestowed upon all who receive with thanksgiving what our God so delights to give." (Ironside, 1983, page 10). 

Multiplied - :gk:`plethuno` is in the aorist passive optative. The aorist tense is a "point of time" tense, and here the meaning is in a  cumulative sense, so Jude is saying, "at all points of time in  your life my wish is that you should receive, (passive voice), an increase and multiplication in your soul of mercy, peace and love". The passive voice shows that these are ministries of the Holy Spirit.

Mercy - :gk:`eleos` -is the deep desire not to see another person hurt and to look after the best interests of others. It is to give the unbeliever the gospel so that they can be spared the horrors of hell. Mercy reflects on  yourself on the basis that if there is something in your life which offends  others you will see this and take steps to rectify it.  Mercy cuts both ways, it is a two edged sword that corrects the soul who possesses it, and challenges all it meets to be kind and considerate.

Peace - :gk:`eirene` - is peace, tranquillity and prosperity of soul. It is the state of the soul of a believer who is secure in the Lord Jesus Christ. If you know you are secure you have peace of mind. The unbeliever seeks such peace in the insecurities of the evils of the world, and we have the obligation to be like a city on a hill, a lamp on a stand, to show what is possible when a person is under the loving care of the living God.

Love - :gk:`agape` - the deep concern for the ultimate well being of others. God alone has this total care for us and we are under his care permanently. If we love others we tell them the truth and share with them the only way out of the emptiness of this world.

Jude is going contrast these characteristics with the attitudes of the apostates, as it is by the characteristics of a person's life and behaviours that you truly know them. As believers we must be fruit inspectors. `Matthew 7`. The fruit that is borne is an indicator as to where the person is; either with the Lord, or with the enemy. It is not the  gifts of the Holy Spirit that give a guide, for some of these can be counterfeited by Satan. The only thing that Satan cannot counterfeit is the holiness of the Lord seen through the believers life in the fruit of the Holy Spirit within them.

Verse  3 - Be sure of your position firstly, be sure of your own ground, before you take on the enemy. Get your armour on and so be ready for the enemy.

Beloved, is your title as a believer, you are loved of God. We were all saved the same way by grace through faith.  There are no super saints. No one should come in and count themselves as special. We are all members of the royalty of the family of God. We are all saved in a common way and so we are all common royalty. We are also workmen studying to show ourselves approved by God. Let us enjoy being workmen. The only place of equality like this is in Christ.

Needful - you must not forget that it will always be necessary to stand for the truth. It is needful that you stand for the truth because where error is present it must be faced even if there is going to be trouble. However before you act make sure you are on firm ground. You contend for the faith; not your opinion of the truth! You contend without being contentious, but when you hear of error you do not let the sun go down without opposing it.  

We must always oppose those who distort the Scriptures. Sit down with them and go  through the Scriptures with them. Jude hadn't intended to write, he had spent over thirty years as a believer and not written before.   It was the challenge that these false teachers gave that forced him to put pen to paper to authoritatively record their condemnation before he passed on and the judgement fell upon the churches who were led astray. 

"The faith once delivered, needs neither angelic nor human additions. It is perfect and complete and the man of God will refuse all other newer revelations." (Ironside, 1983, page 12).

If you have a cultic group in your church the only thing that will give them a chance to reconsider their position is the fruit of the Holy Spirit in your life as you earnestly speak with them. Only with a pure and loving life can you then begin the teaching in that area to show them where they are wrong. They should be asked to examine their own lives and their own motives. If they are contentious but you are holy and loving, you are on solid ground, and the Holy Spirit will be able to work through you and upon them.

The phrase, "once delivered unto the saints" is an important one. The truth of the gospel was once and for all delivered unto the saints.  No one is authorised to change it. Most of the liberal churches fail at this point. The liberals will say that this was all right in the first century but we now know better, we have new information.  That view, Jude says, is false. No additions and no deletions are to be allowed from the word of God.

:gk:`Hapax` is the word used for once and for all. God gave a revelation to the apostles and it stands. What we are writing, Jude states, stands, and do not think that anyone can change it, they can't. No one can come along to correct Paul, John, James or Jude. 

If they say that they are trying to correct the Holy Spirit  who made them to write - aorist, passive participle of :gk:`paradidomi`. It was delivered at one point in time and entrusted to the writers of the Scripture as the authoritative revelation, and it stands until the Lord's return as his word to us, not men's words about God.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not good enough just to believe the word, the life of the believer must be beyond reproach also. Like James, he states that, "it is not enough to uphold the doctrines of Christ, the behaviour must also commend the truth which the lips proclaim." (Ironside, 1983, page 15). 

We live because of God's mercy towards us, and we must operate towards others in the sphere of mercy ourselves. We have received the peace of God that passes all understanding and have the obligation to share this joy with all who will hear of it or wish to know of it. We are loved, and we must be loving. To achieve all this we need, the filling of the Holy Spirit, and this involves confession of sin whenever required. What this involves is prompt dealing with any sin in life (`1 John 1:9`) so that not a shadow comes between us and the Lord and his word and will for our lives.

We are to stand for the faith of the apostles, and argue for that alone; no changes no new policies, just new people and situations to apply the Lord's principles. There is blessing when we do things God's way and trouble when we do things our way!
