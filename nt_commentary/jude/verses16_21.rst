Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"When-ever a man gets out of touch with God he is likely to begin complaining about something. To grumble and moan is one of the distinguishing marks of man without God." (Green , 1968, page 178).

Verse 16  - Jude shows that the apostates are murmurers and create an under tone in the church by their negative attitude. They follow lusts of power, revenge, money, approbation, influence, and sexual lusts. They boast about themselves, and their words are carefully crafted for the effect they want them to have on the listeners. They do not care for truth only the effect on the people they target. They have all the "right words", to get the desired effect, but they simply cover their own pride and lust. They cultivate and target people because of the advantage that may come to them from these people. They are like their master, Satan, cunning, to use and abuse the sheep.

In these verses Jude shows that there is little possibility of the apostates being converted, therefore your concern must be for the sheep they target to fleece. The apostates reject their "place" in the world and God's will for them. In their arrogance they seek a higher place than they are fit for. 

This arrogance is the same as Satan's pride when he fell. He sought to lift himself up, `Isaiah 14:12-18`, and the Lord cast him down. Just so it will be with these men. They claim to be great believers, yet they are far away from, `1 Peter 5:6, 7`. Humility before God and his plan is unknown to them for they are soulish men, not spiritual at all. 

"The deification of humanity and the humanising of deity in the minds of men is the natural outcome of all this." (Ironside, 1983, page 49). "They rebelliously reject the plain commands of God and yet servilely cringe to the humours and caprices of their fellow men." (Plummer, 1896, page 445).

Verse 17 - The Lord warned that the weeds would be allowed to grow with the wheat until the harvest.   `Matthew 13:25-40`. Many will come before him saying what great deeds of healing, exorcism and the like were performed in His name but the Lord will say to them, "Depart from me I never knew you", because they were working under false power.   `Matthew 7:21-23`. They are working under the false gospel which is not a "gospel", at all. `2 Thessalonians 2:1-17`. The mystery of iniquity already works amongst the church.   Believers often do not want to face these nasty things, but for their safety they must. It is a sad fact of human psychology that most people would rather believe good things than bad about people, and every confidence trickster trade on that fact.    

Why do we not see evil? The truth is as close as our own old sin nature; we do not want to throw stones at others as we are very sensitive ourselves about our own sins. Can you not see from this how vital it is to ensure that you deal with sins? Every sin that exists unconfessed within you makes it less likely that you will see and deal with (avoid, or warn others), the sins in others. You should see people as they are and not be naive; there is no excuse, for we have the words of the apostles to guide us. [#]_

.. [#] "The majority of scholars hold that 2 Peter is an expansion of Jude's letter, but these verses suggest that Jude drew on 2 Peter, since Jude not only excludes himself form the apostles of the Lord, but in reciting what the apostles said, he seems to be quoting `2 Peter 3:3`." Refer to Jewish New Testament Commentary, page 783.

	An even better view is expressed in the Liberty Bible Commentary, Vol 2, page 784. "There are close verbal correspondences with `2 Peter 3:3`, and `1 Timothy 4:1`,  which seems to hint at some kind of oral formula in apostolic times."

Verses 18-19  -  Here we have more characteristic of the apostates. These verses give us good guidance, so that if these sorts of people exist in a church they may be spotted quickly and identified as suspicious and possibly apostates. It is unlikely that you will find any person with all characteristics present, but from the fifteen or more in this letter there is enough evidence that can help you pull away from such people before they injure you and your witness. Ignorance of these verses makes the believer vulnerable; apostates can only target those who are not fore-warned and armed with information. Refer `Romans 16:17,18,   Philippians 3:18, 19`.

In the last days, Jude says, there will be mockers, people who walk after their ungodly lusts, people who separate themselves (or make divisions amongst the people of God), people who are sensual, those who do not have the Holy Spirit. Let us look at each of these characteristics, as well as the earlier ones (ten in all).     

Firstly remember the meaning of the phrase, "the last days". It refers to all the period of time since the resurrection and ascension of the Lord. The last days begin when the Lord ascends to heaven; we live in the time of the count down to the end of human history on the earth.

- Murmurers - They are grumblers about everything; they cannot be satisfied. These people are known by the realisation that they can never be satisfied, any changes you make to meet their demands will be met by new demands.

- Complainers They are not happy with their lot in life, and reject the plan of God for them, wishing for a higher place or role, but they lack the ability and/or gifting to fulfil the tasks they seek to do.

- They live according to the standards of their desires. They do not accept the absolute standards of God's Word, rather the relativistic standard of their desires and thoughts, and experiences.

- They speak great swelling words. They are arrogant in their speech and speak to sound important; their accent, intonation of voice and the words they choose indicate that they are phoney. They sound too good to be true. As one wise man said, If a person sounds too good to be true it is probably because they are a phoney.

- They spot people and target them to take advantage of them, either because they are weak and able to be used, or because they are wealthy or powerful in influence and having them as "friends" will advance their interests.

- Mockers - :gk:`empaiktes` - these are people who laugh when they should be thoughtful, they mock things that are serious. The truth is lost in the presence of those who indulge in laughter when thought is called for. If a person responds to a doctrine with a joke they have robbed others of that doctrine. They should be challenged regarding this. If they continue to mock you must deal with them, as if they are apostates.

- Walkers after ungodly lusts - the word means that they walk on a journey and set a pattern for their lives on ungodliness. They do not care about God. He is left out of their lives.

- They separate themselves and cause divisions. :gk:`Apodiorizo` - they make divisive boundaries between themselves and others and create a faction. The division is normally on the basis of pride and therefore indicate that they are superior from the people they are separating from. When the Spirit is moving in the Christians life you want to associate with other Christians, and so by their attitude of superiority they indicate they are apostates. The person who is constantly wanting to disassociate themselves from other believers, who love the Lord, is likely either to be an apostate or a carnal believer.

- Sensual - :gk:`psuchikos`; which means natural, unregenerate or soulish. These people live exactly like all unbelievers (because they are mostly unbelievers), having no spiritual discernment. During the week they live like unbelievers but on Sunday they make a great effort and put on their Sunday face and clothes. This is one of the reasons why those who stand for deacon or pastor should be tested by inquiring of their unbelieving workmates as to their opinion of them. A number of Christians go into the workplace with a big Bible under their arm but no witness except to their hypocrisy. If you are living soulishly your spiritual life will be under question, for the spiritual man or woman will have spiritual fruit in their life and spiritual discernment in their speech.

- They do not have any evidence in their lives that they are indwelt by the Holy Spirit. The Word of God is clear on this matter, they that have not the Holy Spirit are none of His - `Romans 8:9-13`. The only sign that they have the Holy Spirit is that they have a holy life, the fruit of the Holy Spirit in their daily walk through the world. The holy life does not mean speaking in tongues, or doing miracles, for all these may be counterfeited!

Verses 20-21 - The behaviours of the true believer are now contrasted to the lives of the apostates. What do we do about the presence of these people in the church? We do not get distracted by them! We warn others against them, we expel them from the fellowship and we strengthen ourselves in the truth. The first thing we do is, in fact, to look at ourselves and be strong in the Lord. You are beloved, they are apostate. Your growth depends on you feeding on God's Word, believe it, apply it in your life , growing spiritually upon the foundation of our most holy faith. That foundation is the grace and mercy and love of God for us. "A definite command follows; keep yourself in the love of God. Mark that, it is not keep God loving you!" (Ironside, 1983, page 54). "To be conscious of being beloved by God is one of the great protections that the believer can possess." (Plummer, 1896, page 457).

Jude uses the word "holy" - :gk:`hagios` - and this means set apart for service. In combination with this he mentions prayer, and that is appropriate for the two go together where faith is genuine. Praying in the Spirit means that the person should pray under the control of the Holy Spirit.  `Ephesians 6:18`. This does not mean speaking in tongues it means praying in fellowship with the Holy Spirit, in obedience to the revealed word of God and with sins dealt with in life. As you feed on God's Word you learn more about God's policy. In your prayer life you will repeat it back to God so that it becomes a reality in your life, and fellowship with the Lord so that it becomes a living part of you. You talk about God's will for your life, to God, in your prayers.

Keep yourself in the love of God, live in the sphere of God's love. His banner over you is love. Protect yourself by being occupied with Christ giving thanks to Him as you walk through the day. When you face temptation you resist by looking at the Cross, and reminding yourself of his love for you.

We are also to be looking in keen expectation for the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. You are to spend eternity with Him; remember that and in time resist the temptation now to sin. Start enjoying living with Him now, let the sure expectation of the future change the power of the present temptation.

In verse 21 Jude looks both ways to find the source of strength for the believer. We should let the past change us as well as the future. You have a faith that rests in what has happened and a faith in what will happen. 

Both realities stabilise us in the truth and provide a focus for us in each moment of each day. "It was by flagrant disobedience that the false teachers had fallen out of love with God, and thus inevitably, with men as well." (Green , 1968, page 185). To ignore the Word and worse to oppose it will lead to a self centredness that has apostasy at its end point.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

The apostates practise politics, they target influential or weak people and speak to them; they craft their messages and conversations to secure personal advantage. This sort of "ministry technique" is the devils own.    If you do this as a minister your ministry is finished. You are called to preach the word and the Lord will raise up people to support you. As pastor you are navigator of the ship, you need to look out for these crowd pleasers and never seek to copy them.

Believers are fooled many times by apostates in the church because they are not ready for them. They do not expect to be led astray in the church. The Lord and the apostles warned about Satan's tactics in the church. The main opposition for believers is from within the church, while the places of ill repute can be the source of your converts.

We must ensure we know the full counsel of God's Word so that we are never outfoxed by the apostates. We must have these ten characteristics well applied in our minds so that we "sense", these people before they have the chance to cause trouble.
