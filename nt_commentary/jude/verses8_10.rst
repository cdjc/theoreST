Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"The profane libertines allow themselves to speak evil of dignities in a way which even as archangel did not venture to adopt in rebuking Satan.  It is a very strong argument afortiori." (Plummer, 1896, page 419)
 
We have Scripture as our example, and we are to take its examples seriously. Even Satan is to be treated with respectful words, as a higher created being to us. This may seem strange to our modern ears, but the reason is based in the vital principle of the creation, and God's order is not to be broken or insulted. The angels were created superior to us and, while we in Christ have a superior position to them now, we are not to usurp a superiority we do not have in and of ourselves. The angels, elect or fallen are not to be insulted, or abused in any way. We will one day judge them and destroy the fallen angels, 1 Corinthians 6:3, but until that day we are to follow Michael's example, and recognise that our superiority rests in our position with our Saviour, and his rebuke alone is appropriate for the angels, and for Satan.

Verse 8  - Jude calls these false teachers "the filthy dreamers". By using the word for dreamers, he indicates that these people are like the pagan mystics who dream dreams and spin fantasies. They claim to have wonderful things to tell us, but they are not in touch with reality and to listen to them is to enter a world that does not tally with reality!. Beware of those who have dreams and visions yet their lives are not holy. Many people go around being big on dreams and visions but small on holy lives and obedience to Bible teaching.

"Filthy dreamers" have no respect for authority or for leadership in the church. They think they are super spiritual - their lives are a mess but they are having visions and dreams, so they believe they are special, and above the rules that "lower" status believers have to live by. You cannot be polite to a filthy dreamer;  they are to be corrected and if they will not be obedient to the word rejected from the fellowship.

A minister must be tough on this according to the Scriptures because God's standard must be kept. Learn from history, even the archangel respects authority. When a pastor will not listen to a dreamer, the dreamer will run down the pastor. The reason is clear; they accept their experience above the word of God, where-as the true believer corrects their experience by the Word of God.    

Verse 9 - Even when Michael was contending with Satan over the body of Moses he recognised the authority that belonged to Satan. The Lord rebuke you he said. This story is alluded to in scripture but not directly contained in our Bible. Deuteronomy 34:5,6,  Zechariah 3:1. While we do not accept Rabbinic tradition as all true, the Rabbinic commentary on Deuteronomy 34: 6 (Rabbah 11:12), is by Jude's inclusion of it here certified by the Holy Spirit as true and scriptural.

The apostate here is not a believer who has ceased to be a believer but is one who has come in and seemed to be like a believer, or one that has known the truth but rejected it and walked away and has continued to live in error. They are "make believers" who, knowing the truth are wilfully rejecting it. These people are dangerous, as they know the truth and are therefore more effective at undermining the church. They raise experience up above Scripture, and once what we "feel", or think we have dreamed, becomes the standard for truth we have no stability in life at all.

These apostates worm themselves into churches, sneaking in through the back door. They have no respect for any sort of authority, the authority of God's Word or the authority of the pastor, elders or deacons. These people are led by their lusts, and they hold their views more precious than God's word. 

In Galatians 5 Paul makes it clear that you are either walking under the power of the Holy Spirit or in the power of the Old Sin Nature. 

The apostate of course must walk under the old sin nature. The inner corruption of these people's lives will eventually come out, but once they are identified, action must be taken against them lest they destroy others. It is important as pastors you spot this before the rotten fruit becomes visible to all, for by then it will be too late. If you do not sort these people out you will have a lot of your weakly and sick sheep slaughtered by them. You will be unpopular opposing these people, for many of your sheep will not see their danger until they have grown up further, but you must act on God's word not desire for popularity.

Verse 10 - Just like the people of Noah's day, the evil inhabitants of Sodom, and the Israelites of the Exodus generation, the "apostates" of Jude's day kept right on with Satanic policy and demonstrated their ignorance by their words. So it remains true until our own day; those who place their opinions above God's word do and will continue to exult their ideas above the revelation of God.  Refer 2 Peter 2:12 for the parallel verse.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Too many believers today have been led astray by extremes within the Pentecostal movement and they are speaking "against" Satan and the fallen angels, saying insulting things against Satan and getting good laughs from their congregations by so doing. This is condemned by this passage. We are to say nothing about Satan or the demons that is not said by the Word of God. We are to pray that the Lord will keep us from their attacks and from all evil, and pray with confidence for the Lord's judgement upon them all.
 
Satan's men think they ought to be the pastor, not you. Jude said that the only thing these people are expert in is their old sin nature and they follow this like slaves. Let the Word deal with them as you preach it directly and systematically.   As a pastor you must confront them and contend for the faith. If you do not stop the wolves you will have the sheep ripped apart right, left and centre. Get doctrine right in your own life and in the life of your congregation. Sexual immorality is to be fled from, and so is any disrespect towards Satan;  he and his strategies are to be respectfully feared and avoided.
