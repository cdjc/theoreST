*1:4-7* The Character of Philemon
---------------------------------

.. biblepassage:: Philemon 1:4-7

Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*verse 4* Philemon is mature. He owns slaves and is a mature believer. Paul is thankful for him. There are many believers whom Paul is not thankful for.

    Remove this sentence, or give some further explanation with references.

“Thank” is the present active indicative of :gk:`Eucharisteo`, Present tense means that it is a constant thing, the active voice means Paul does it with the indicative showing the reality of the thankfulness.

Out of respect comes love. Paul thanks “my God” which is the dative singular with the definite article used for a personal pronoun. This is better translated "I thank our God".

    I checked a few versions (ESV, NET, KJV, NASB, NIV, RSV, Amp), and they all had "my God".
    If you really want to go against all of those, you'll have to make a better case.

"Making mention of you at the time of my prayers" is the present middle participle of :gk:`Poieo`. The present tense is a descriptive present. He is praying for him still.

    Ideally, I'd like the commentary to be as bible-version independent as possible.
    This phrase doesn't appear in the KJV, and is rendered differently (though
    more-or-less equivalently) in other versions. The difference is enough that
    a reader not using the KJV might struggle to follow the flow of ideas here.

"Mention" is the accusative singular direct object of :gk:`Mneia` which means remembering those whom you love.

:gk:`Pantote` translated "always" means that he does this at any time he prays. We are told to pray without ceasing but this really means to pray with the frequency of a hacking cough.

.. sidebar:: "frequency of a hacking cough"

    I couldn't find anything about hacking coughs related to pantote. Reference? Or just remove it and replace with a more accepted definition.

:gk:`Epi` and :gk:`Proseuche` means "at the time of my prayers" not "in my prayers" which would be the word :gk:`En` rather than :gk:`Epi`.

.. sidebar:: "in my prayers"

    All the versions I checked (ESV, NET, KJV, NASB, NIV, RSV, Amp) translate as "in my prayers". I don't know greek (yet!), but are you sure you're willing to go against all those?

Translation v 4 – "I keep thanking our God at all times making mention of you at the time of my prayers."

*verse 5* In verse 5 we have the love and faith which Philemon has towards two objects, the Lord Jesus Christ and towards the saints.

This is :gk:`Pros` plus the accusative which means face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ. 

.. sidebar:: This is "Pros"
    :class: comment
    
    Clarify the first part. It doesn't make sense to me.

"Towards all saints" is the word :gk:`Eis` plus the accusative of :gk:`Hagios`. The object of his love in this case are other believers.

*verse 6* Philemon is told in this letter that he is not facing a runaway slave but a mature believer now. How is he going to handle this new situation?

.. sidebar:: Philemon is told in this letter...

    There is no clear link between verse 6 and these two sentences.

“That” is the conjunction :gk:`Hopos` which should be translated ‘in order that’

.. sidebar:: 'in order that'
    :class: comment
    
    in the NET bible, Hopos is translated "so that" 22 times, "so" 5 times, twice "How" or "that", and once "Then what", "In this way", "This", "may", "to", and "as to how". It is not translated "in order that" - though it may be in other versions (I didn't have their details handy).

Communication is the word :gk:`Koinonia` which means fellowship. This phrase – "that our communication" should be translated "in order that our association"

The word :gk:`Pistis` deals with the doctrine which Philemon knows and is able to work on as a mature Christian.

    I don't understand what is being said in this sentence.

“May become” is the middle active subjunctive of :gk:`Ginomai` which means to become something that you were not before.

"Become effectual" is :gk:`Energes` which means to be operational.

"By the acknowledging" is :gk:`En` plus the instrumental of :gk:`Epignosis`.

"Of every good thing" is :gk:`Pas Agathos` which means of all the intrinsic good which is in you.

"In Christ Jesus" should be translated "towards Christ Jesus".

.. sidebar:: "towards Christ Jesus"
    :class: comment
    
    "for the sake of Christ" is a common translation.

Translation – "In order that our association with reference to the doctrine that you have in you may become operational towards Christ by means of epignosis of all the intrinsic good in you."

    This is a very difficult sentence to understand. I'm not sure this translation will help a reader.

*verse 7* Philemon has doctrine in his soul. The word ‘for we have ’ is :gk:`Gar` plus the singular ingressive aorist of :gk:`Echo` which means "for I have come to have". Epaphras the pastor of the church has brought information about Philemon and that has given great blessing to Paul.

.. sidebar:: Philemon has doctrine in his soul
    :class: comment
    
    I'm not sure how you conclude that Philemon has "doctrine in his soul". What do you mean by that?

"Great" is the accusative singular of :gk:`Poulos` :gk:`Chara` which could be translated "much happiness". Paul possesses a happiness of a mature believer plus his happiness which overflows due to his contact with other mature Christians. 

"Consolation" is the accusative singular of the noun :gk:`Paraklesis` which means "encouragement".

"Because the bowels of the saints" is :gk:`Hote` plus :gk:`Splagchnon` is better translated "tender affection of the saints".

"Refreshed" is the aorist passive indicative of :gk:`Anapauo` which "means have been refreshed" with the passive voice indicating receiving of refreshment. 

Philemon, the mature believer has been a great refreshment to all he meets, even his slaves.

"By thee” is :gk:`Dia` plus the genitive of the pronoun :gk:`Su` which means "through you".

He addresses Philemon by the word :gk:`Adelphoi` as he is taking up a family matter and is not going to use his rank of apostleship.

Translation--- "For I have come to much happiness and encouragement by your love for God because the tender affections of believers has been refreshed through you brother."

Onesimus is about to appear and this is going to test the maturity of Philemon. The ministry of refreshment is likely to be challenged.

Under Roman law because of what Onesimus has done Philemon has the right to torture his slave, brand him or even kill him. He legally is able to do this however he will not have a spirit of refreshment if he follows this legal path.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

*verse 4* It is to God’s glory that people reach maturity and they have a mutual respect.

We are to love the brethren, we are to have :gk:`agape` type love.

    Replace archaic "bretheren" with "fellow believers" or something? (Further down also)

When you are thankful for someone you pray for them. 

*verse 5* Love for the Lord Jesus Christ and the brethren is the ultimate of maturity in our spiritual life. `1 John 4:20,21,  James 2:8`

    The wording is a bit awkward

If you are occupied with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ you are not going to be too concerned about what believers are doing or not doing, or what their attitude is towards you is, but you should be concerned for them.

Maturity results in stability towards others and agape love towards them.

.. sidebar:: stability
    :class: comment
    
    What do you mean by stability?

*verse 6* The doctrine in the Bible must be absorbed by you and turned into working knowledge.

The life of Philemon was a testimony. “Every good thing” was the result of the fact that, from `Philippians 2:13`:

.. biblepassage:: Philippians 2:13


*verse 7* Do you by your Christian life give happiness to those about you?

If people come into contact with you are they refreshed?

This is a grace crisis and is the purpose of the epistle. The principle is that a person who is 100% right can do the right thing but lose the refreshing of others by doing the right thing but not the best thing. 

Can Philemon avoid the pitfalls of legalism and operate on grace? 

If you choose legalism you can become self righteous and cast a pall of gloom wherever you go. 

If you choose grace you can be refreshing to others. 

The principle here is that I would rather choose grace than be “right” according to the law.

Characteristics of a faithful believer from Philemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Gives others cause for thanksgiving (verse 4).  Is a source of blessing.

   Prayer:

   a. A sacrifice of the Believer-priest, `Hebrews 13:15`.

   #. A balance to Bible study, `Acts 6:4`.

   #. Has great power when Divinely energised, `James 5:16b`

   #. A constant discipline of the spiritual Believer, `1 Thessalonians 5:19`.

   #. Certain of answers when Bible based, `1 John 5:14,15`

   #. Follows divinely given method:

      i. To the Father

      #. In the power of the Holy Spirit

      #. In the name of the Son

   When confession is necessary it is the only prayer God will hear, `Psalm 66:18, 1 John 1:9`

        This section on prayer doesn't seem to fit under point 1. Should it be a point on its own, or just removed?

.. sidebar:: pray to the father, through Holy Spirit, in name of Son
    :class: comment
    
     In Wayne Grudem's book *Systematic Theology*, he gives a well-balanced argument suggesting we need not be legalistic about praying this way - and talking to Jesus or the Holy Spirit can at times be a legitimate way to pray.

#. Takes up cross daily (verse 5). Faith to Christ, love to the saints, `Matthew 22:37-40, Luke 9:23`.

#. Fellowship/knowledge are practical.  “Effective” (verse 7) knows and uses spiritual resources, `Ephesians 1:3`.

#. Edifies fellow Believers (verse 7).

#. Can be counted on to be obedient and faithful (verses 8-9).

   Principle:  Conformity to Christ, `Romans 8:29, 12:2, Matthew 10:25`.
