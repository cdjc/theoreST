Introduction
------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

This letter was written together with Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians during Paul’s
first Roman imprisonment. Its position in the Bible was chosen by the Church Fathers who saw
that it was like Timothy and Titus, a letter to an individual, rather than an epistle to a
corporate group as were the other prison epistles.

Background
----------

Geographical
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Philemon lived in a city called Colossae which was in modern day Asiatic Turkey in the
Phrygian country called Anatolia.

There is no city there today, just the ruins but it was a great city at the time of Paul. A
companion epistle was written to the church at Colossae, the epistle to the Colossians.

The Main Players
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Philemon
........

Philemon was a very rich man who had come to a saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He
apparently had come down to Ephesus and listened to Paul who spoke daily for two years at
the school of Tyrannus.
        
He was a mature Christian for after his conversion under Paul’s ministry he had grown under
the teaching ministry of Paul.
        
He was a long term friend of Paul and a leader of the church at Colossae though not the
pastor.

Onesimus
........

Onesimus was the slave of Philemon who robbed his master and fled to Rome. His idea was to
become lost in the huge population of Rome and therefore evade recapture.
        
In some wonderful way Onesimus’ path crossed that of Paul resulting in his conversion to
the Lord Jesus Christ.
        
Onesimus becomes a servant of Paul as well as growing under his teaching becoming a mature
believer.
        
Paul knew that under Roman law Onesimus must be returned to his master and to clarify and
assist in this rather difficult situation he writes a letter to Philemon.
        
Onesimus returns to Philemon in company with the pastors of the Ephesian and Colossian
churches who are also taking letters from Paul back to their respective churches.
        
Paul asks in a very gracious manner that Philemon take Onesimus back, not as a free man but
a servant who is a brother in Christ.
        
Here we have a free man addressing a brother who is a slave owner about another brother who
is a slave. Paul also asks Philemon to prepare a room for his future visit which must have
given Onesimus additional comfort.
        
Paul
....

The great apostle in chains in prison in Rome is able to give Philemon, who he sees as
completely in the right, guidance as to how to tackle this problem in the best way.
        
Paul had had experience in this area with his rejection of John Mark for the second
missionary journey after Mark had deserted Paul on the first.
        
Paul is also looking forward to his release and going to meet up with his friend Philemon
in the future.
        
This epistle demonstrates that letter writing can be a ministry from God if we allow it to
be so.  A person who finds it difficult to speak sometimes finds writing a better way.
        
Slavery
~~~~~~~

Slavery was a great evil in the ancient world but it was also part of the 
ancient world. If there is anywhere in the Bible where you would expect a
social manifesto regarding the abolition of slavery it would have been here.

Roman Empire
............

There were approximately sixty million slaves in the Roman Empire which 
represented about half of the population. If they had revolted en masse 
the Roman Empire would have fallen overnight.

Under Roman law a run away slave could be beaten to death or killed any
way the master wanted to or he could be pardoned. Paul is sticking to the
letter of the law.

The Romans had a law that if a slave killed his master and was protected
by other slaves in the household all the slaves would be killed.
At the time of writing this the Senate was debating a case where a
very cruel master had been killed by a slave and protected by his fellow
slaves. After days of debate all the 300 slaves were killed, 
men women and children.

    Reference would be good.

Slavery was therefore a very important social issue in Paul’s day not 
unlike apartheid in recent times.

    Not sure the comparison between slavery in ancient Rome and apartheid
    in recent history is more beneficial than confusing. Also, many people
    younger than I would not know what apartheid is - at least from a social
    issue perspective anyway. (Would be more relevant in the 80's, perhaps)

It is of note that one thing Paul does not do is to ask Philemon to set 
the slaves free. Paul is working from within the institution to humanise 
it from within. From a Scriptural viewpoint slavery is dealt with in 
:verse:`1 Corinthians 7:20-22`.


Here we see that a free man who was converted became a slave of Christ
while a slave who was converted was seen to be free in Christ. Slavery
was neither commended nor condemned by the early church.
The issue is "What do you think of Christ?"

    Reworded to: "What do you think of Christ?"
    
A modern Example
................

When the evil is abolished society will not fall apart with it. However
with force or a revolution there are no winners but many losers.

    This sentence doesn't really make sense to me. Suggest rewording.

As a modern example, following the Civil War in America, there were 
more problems for the slaves than before the war.

It is of interest 
that Stonewall Jackson, one of the Confederate Generals in the 
American Civil War used to take time off to go and teach the Negro 
slaves and their children Bible Class. He looked upon his slaves as 
his children, his responsibility, so that they had food, clothing and 
the gospel.

    I don't think he took time off during the war, but earlier.

We need to set an example and show what light can do in 
the darkness. It is only as lives are transformed that society is 
transformed as well.

Evil is in the world when we are born and will 
still be here after we leave. Social reform will come naturally with 
the spread of biblical principles in a nation.

    I think this section needs to be more unambiguously anti-slavery. I don't
    want us to be open to the possibility of being accused of being accepting of slavery.

Theological Pictures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we have a glorious picture of the doctrine of imputation, the 
act of reckoning something to another’s account.

Here we have a person who is in a totally hopeless position whose 
debt will be willingly paid for another.

We also have the challenge of grace and legalism with Philemon who 
is not only legally able to kill his slave but also to pardon him.

The Purpose of the Letter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary purpose of this epistle is to reveal Christ’s love for 
us in what He did for us. This is one of the finest illustrations of 
substitution.

Another theme running through this letter is:

(a) Spiritual growth `v 1-3|Philemon 1:1-3`
(b) Characteristics of a faithful believer `v 4-7|Philemon 1:4-7`
(c) Reflections of Christ `v 8-20|Philemon 1:8-20`
(d) Abiding with Christ `v 21-25|Philemon 1:21-25`

The practical purpose is to teach brotherly love. These men 
belonging to two different classes in the Roman Empire, hating each 
other and hurting each other, are now brothers in Christ, and they 
are to act like it.

    The original lists the four sections at this point, but I feel this is redundant,
    as the four sections are clearly listed in the contents, and listing
    them here does not provide any additional information. TODO: Might revisit this
    decision later, in order for all commentaries to have a uniform structure.
