*1:22-25* Salutations and Conclusion
------------------------------------

.. biblepassage:: Philemon 1:22-25

Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Epaphras was a native of Colossae and the founder of the Colossian church. He was probably a convert of Paul and had evangelised Colossae as well as Laodicea and Hierapolis. `Colossians 1:7, 4:12, 13`. He is with Aristarchus said to be a fellow prisoner with Paul and this probably means that he shared imprisonment with Paul.

John Mark’s house was the place where the first church met. He accompanied Barnabus after the rejection by Paul. Mark is now a great comfort to Paul.

Marcus is John Mark who had been eligible for the Levitical priesthood but he cut off the tip of his finger so that he was not physically perfect and could not function in the priesthood.

    Reference?

John Mark had been rejected by Paul to join the second missionary team after Mark had left Paul suddenly in the first missionary journey.

The inclusion of Mark is an indication to Philemon that Paul had failed in the test with Mark, a very similar test which Philemon is now facing with Onesimus.

Aristarchus means best ruler. He was a very famous man in the city. He was a Roman knight. He is someone from Thessalonika who joined Paul on his third missionary journey. `Acts 19:29` shows that he survived mob action.  

He was influenced by Bible truths rather than evil.

Both Paul and Aristarchus were consistent in their Christian life.

    A couple of paragraphs ago, Paul 'failed' in his test. What do you mean here by 'consistent'

We also have Demas who fell away from the mature Christian life and Lucas or Luke, the author of the gospel and the book of Acts.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Problems are opportunities when you see what God has provided in your life.

The church at Colossae could be destroyed by false doctrine which is answered in the book of Colossians or legalism which is dealt with in Philemon.

The answer to legalism and dissension is getting to maturity. Spiritual maturity is a solution to problems, conflict and controversy.

Abiding with Christ - verses 21-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Fellowship depends on obedience, verse 21. It is obedience that brings “benefit” and “refreshment” to Christ, verses 20,21.

#. We are to prepare our souls as a suitable dwelling for Christ, verse 22. `John 14:21`, “He who keeps My commands... I will disclose Myself to him.” `John 15:4`, “Abide in Me and I in you.”

#. When we gave Him the first place in our lives, He is at home in our hearts. `Colossians 1:18, 1 Peter 3:15, Ephesians 3:16-17`.

#. We must always beware of falling from steadfastness in grace, verses 24-25 “Demas”--- see `2 Timothy 4:10`, contrast Mark--- `Acts 13:13, 15:38, 2 Timothy 4:11`.

Falling From Grace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. At salvation, God’s grace gives us a position and place of standing before God, `Romans 5:2, Ephesians 1:6`.

#. The goal of the spiritual life is to make our position in Christ and our practice one and the same.

#. We cannot fall from that which we cling to. `Hebrews 10:23` “hold fast”.

#. When we cast off our Christian commitment (`1 Timothy 5:12`), we let go of God’s grace.

#. This is not loss of salvation, it is loss of spiritual living.

#. The Galatians illustrate this condition.

   a. Turn from Spirit to flesh, `Galatians 3:3`.

   #. Turn from grace (faith) to law, `Galatians 3:2`

   #. Fallen from grace, `Galatians 5:4` compare verses 1-7.


#. The same is seen in the church of Ephesus, `Revelation 2:5`.
