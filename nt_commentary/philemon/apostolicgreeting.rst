*1:1-3* The Apostolic Greeting - Salutation to the Body of Christ
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. biblepassage:: Philemon 1:1-3

Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*verse 1* Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ shows that Paul who 
is an apostle is not going to claim rank over a mature believer 
in Philemon. This is going to allow Philemon to act on the basis 
of his own unhindered free will in relation to Onesimus.

.. draftcomment:: claim rank
    :class: comment
    
    I think 'claim rank' is a bit too colloquial. Also, it might not
    translate very well. Suggest rewording

Paul approaches him as a fellow ambassador not as an apostle. 
This means that he will approach him on the basis of equality. 
He approaches him as a friend. This is a personal letter to a personal friend.

He is not a prisoner of Nero, he is a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
While he is in prison he is innocent and will die as an innocent man. 
Yet Paul in verse 13 advocates capital punishment. 
Both the Lord Jesus Christ and Paul died as innocent people 
by capital punishment but both advocated it.

.. draftcomment:: ...not a prisoner of Nero...
    :class: comment

    Well, he *is* a prisoner of Nero too. Perhaps this should be reworded
    to something like "Though he is a prisoner of Nero,
    he identifies himself as a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
    
.. draftcomment:: advocating capital punishment
    :class: comment
    
    I'm not convinced. On the spectrum *accept - agree - advocate*, 
    I would tend not place either Paul or Jesus at the 'advocate' end.
    If anything, I think the weight of scripture tends against
    capital punishment (though my opinion is lightly held: I have done
    little research and I know many are in favour).

Timothy called “our brother” should be “the brother”. 
He is brother to all Christians.

By calling Philemon our dearly beloved Paul confirms that 
what Philemon is doing is effective. In these verses we see 
different people addressed in different ways showing different 
works in the body of Christ. Here we see the wife and son of 
Philemon addressed and it is further expanded to the entire church at Colossae.

.. draftcomment:: wife and son
    :class: comment
    
    I don't think we are certain that Philemon's wife and son are the
    other people mentioned. Even if those identities are probable, I
    would recommend using language that allows for the possibility 
    of being wrong: "Here we most probably see the wife..." or
    something like that.

The Colossian church is facing two problems. One is Gnosticism 
which is dealt with in the epistle to the Colossians, the other 
is slavery which he addresses in this letter.

*verse 2* Philemon is a fellow worker. He is not a pastor, 
whereas Archippus is a fellow soldier, a fellow pastor.

.. draftcomment:: fellow soldier
    :class: comment
    
    I'm not convinced that 'fellow soldier' *necessarily* implies pastor.

Paul approaches slavery on the basis of salvation, spirituality and
grace. The Bible did not take a stand against slavery but did
emphasise to grow in grace `1 Timothy 6:1-7`. 

Philemon is a wealthy mature believer and one of the leaders in 
the church at Colossae. Onesimus however is a run-away unbelieving 
slave who has stolen a large sum of money.

.. draftcomment:: large sum of money
    :class: comment
    
    How do we know? I don't think v 18-19 necessarily imply that
    Onesimus stole a large sum of money.

*verse 3* In verse 3 we have the usual greeting with grace to you
and peace opening the letter. It is noted that the grace and peace
is from God the Father and the Son and not from the Holy Spirit.
The entire work for the Holy Spirit is to glorify Christ.

.. draftcomment:: holy spirit

    This is painting with a very broad brush, and I think it may give
    a wrong impression about the work of the Holy Spirit. 

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Paul did not bemoan his situation being unjustly imprisoned. His 
attitude is that the Lord has allowed him to be in prison. He knows 
that “All things worked together for good” In this case it was during 
this period that the four great prison epistles, which are the most 
concentrated doctrinal books in the Bible, were written. We should be 
content with our circumstances.

If your master is an unbeliever honour your master and recognise his 
authority and work harder than any other slave. If you have a Christian 
master do not be disrespectful to them but serve them more. You have 
to work harder for them. As a slave we should do our job as unto the Lord.

What kind of people make up the body of Christ?

- A prisoner- Paul (of Christ).  `2 Timothy 2:9` - There are no accidents in God’s plan.

- A brother- Timothy.  `Acts 16:1-2` - All Believer’s are born into God’s family.

- A fellow worker- Philemon - Every Believer is called to serve (gifted).

- A sister- Apphia  (Probably Philemon’s wife) - Women have equal standing in Christ. 
  While Philemon was a Greek name and he was a citizen of Collosae, Apphia is a Phrygian name.

    Inserted 'Probably'.
    
    I couldn't find any evidence to support Apphia
    as being of Phyrgian origin. Most sources said greek.

- A fellow soldier- Archippus. `Colossians 4:17` - A pastor/teacher
  of the word of God.  The life of faith is a warfare. `Ephesians 6:10-18`,  
  The good fight. `1 Timothy 1:13, 6:12`, The good soldier.  `2 Timothy 2:2`

    Is this verse reference correct?

And to the church in thy house indicates that the church at Colossae met at Philemon’s house. It was the practice to meet in houses for the first two hundred years of the Church Age.

.. draftcomment:: Church Age
    :class: comment
    
    'Age' seems redundant here, and capitalisation unnecessary.
    Could just be *... of the church.*

It is clear that the body of Christ is composed of all kinds of people, in every kind of circumstances with one thing in common, faith in Christ.  `2 Peter 1:1 , 1 Corinthians 12`.

They are all at different levels of spiritual growth. How do we grow spiritually?

Spiritual Growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is a command - `2 Peter 3:18`. See `2 Peter 1:5-7, Hebrews 5:11-14`
 
#. It naturally must follow spiritual birth. - `John 3:7` “You must be born again”, `1 Peter 2:2` “As newborn babes, desire the milk that you may grow.”

#. The object of growth is maturity and service. – `Hebrews 6:1` “Let us press on to maturity.”, `Ephesians 2:10` “created in Christ unto good works.”

#. Requires diligent use of two resources. God’s Word (food) `Matthew 4:4, Romans 10:17, 2 Timothy 2:15`, God’s Spirit (exercise)

   In relation to the Spirit we are told to: 
  
   a. Grieve not - `Ephesians 4:30` (avoid sins) use of `1 John 1:9`
   #. Quench not - `1 Thessalonians 5:19, 2 Timothy 1:6` - feed the spirit more than the body.
   #. Walk in- `Galatians 5:16,18,25, Romans 8:4,13,14`.
   #. Be filled- `Ephesians 5:18` (result of consistently walking- c/f. verse 2, 8)

#. Growth is illustrated by a plant. `Mark 4:8,20, John 15:1-8`

   a. Philemon `verses 4-9|Philemon 1:4-9` The life of faith.
   #. Transforming power. `1 Kings 19:19-21`
   #. New creature `2 Corinthians 5:17, 1 Corinthians 6:14, 11:1`
   #. Steps of growth `2 Peter 1:5-7`. 

.. draftcomment:: Spritual Growth
    :class: comment
    
    Rethink the structure of this section.
    
    Point 3 is initially about spiritual food/exercise,
    but then the rest of the point is about what we are told in relation to the spirit.
    
    Point 4 is about growth being illustrated by a plant, but the subpoints have nothing
    to do with plants.
