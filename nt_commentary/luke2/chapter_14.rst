Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:1-2
    :bold:

The Sabbath meal was one which Jewish people considered most important and auspicious for important
visitors to attend, as it honoured the family.   It was particularly good and noble to invite a
prominent teacher, and you were seen as important if the teacher attended.  Again a Pharisee invites
Jesus Christ out to dinner with ulterior motives. This time it is one of the leading Pharisees,
possibly even a member of the Sanhedrin. The fact that treachery rather than fellowship around the
meal is the basis of the request makes it even worse when the Sabbath meal’s status is understood.

The Pharisee also invites a man with dropsy to see if the Lord Jesus Christ would heal on the
Sabbath.  Dropsy causes the body to swell due to fluid retention, and was predominantly a cardio-
vascular disease, although some symptom pictures in the ancient world could be caused by kidney
problems.  Luke’s precision as a doctor indicates that this is fluid retention causing uncomfortable
painful swelling around joints and over the entire body.  The scene is set, with a pathetic case, at
a meal where the sick man cannot really enjoy the food, and is placed strategically for the Lord to
see him, and it is the Sabbath Day.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:3-6
    :bold:

The Lord directly confronts the “set up” here and does the right thing – directly discussed the
principle behind the Law, and the application of the Mosaic Law in such/all cases.  He takes the
time to teach that the true biblical concept of “Sabbath rest” also includes being always able to
heal on that day, even above others. The Jewish legal experts used to argue back and forth regarding
the Sabbath and other legal matters, and when one side became silent they were considered to have
lost the argument. The Pharisees allowed people to rescue animals on the Sabbath unlike the Essenes
thus strengthening the Lord’s argument as to the value of the human above the animal.  They fall
silent, for they have no argument.

To the Lord Jesus Christ what he did with the healing of the man with the case of the dropsy was an
act of divine love and such love never ceases, even on the Sabbath, indeed, especially on the
Sabbath.  `John 5:17`.  The Lord’s point is that the Sabbath speaks of God’s grace in the creation
of the entire space-time universe, where mankind was challenged to take one day out of time, and
spend it in worship of the one who had given them all good things.  Such an order does not preclude
doing good, indeed it demands that if good can be done, it is not work, it is more worship.  The man
is healed and “let go”.  Note that phrase, for the Pharisees had the man there at the meal, not to
enjoy food, for he could not, but under orders, simply to catch the Lord, so the Lord “lets him go”
in all senses of the phrase.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:7-11
    :bold:

Some of these banquets had well known teachers participating or speaking as a major feature of them.
People would be invited to the dinner to hear the “after dinner rabbi” who was speaking, much as
political fund raising dinners are arranged today.  There was a very strict hierarchy of importance,
which was emphasised by the seating of the guests at the meal. This was also the case in both Roman
and Greek banquets. This caused inequality, such as described in `1 Corinthians 11:21`, **“For in
eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.”**

The principle given by our Lord reflects `Proverbs 25:6-7`, “**Put not forth thyself in the presence
of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: 7 For better it is that it be said unto thee,
Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes
have seen.”**

The closer one was to the host the greater was the guest’s place of honour. As people entered the
room in the Pharisees’ house where the tables were laid out they must have scrambled to the seats at
the head of the table, but the senior servant/steward of the household would direct, or re-direct
the guests to assigned places – as in today’s special dinners we have a “seating plan” – where
people are assigned individual seats.

In Greek or Roman circles no one who was socially inferior would be invited forward, unless they had
sat themselves in too low a position, and were being publically honoured for some special service.
In this parable Jesus shows that it is better to be humble and be promoted, rather than to assume a
high position and be demoted with the summary being in verse 11.  Those who over estimated their
importance and settled in to a great seat, would have the humiliation of being asked to go to the
back of the crowded room, in the eyes of all.  `1 Corinthians 3:10-23, 2 Corinthians 5:6-21`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:12-14
    :bold:

The Pharisees enjoyed being seen to be hospitable, but they were always very careful to choose only
people who could return the hospitality. True hospitality in God’s Kingdom is not like this, Jesus
argues. It has the basis of grace, and is based on inviting people who could never repay the
hospitality in kind.  The Lord has invited us to His Table, and we can never repay the compliment,
but we can worship and serve in grace and love towards others.  `John 15:3-17, 1 John 3:16-22,
4:7-19`.

Not to invite people of one’s own social status would offend them, but then the Lord Jesus Christ
said, that the other’s need rather than their social standing must determine true hospitality.  It
is the focus upon “others” that shows the fruit of the Holy Spirit, and is the mark of the true
member of the kingdom of God.  `Proverbs 14:20, 22:16`,

`Proverbs 19:17` gave the principle of being blessed by assisting the poor, **“He that hath pity
upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.” **On this
basis our recompense will be in heaven when we receive our rewards at the first resurrection.
`Daniel 12:1-3, John 5:25-29`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:15-24
    :bold:

In this parable the Lord Jesus Christ uses the picture of a supper where certain important ones are
invited. However the invited guests make excuses one after another as to their inability to attend.
It is not that they cannot attend, but that they do not want to attend; they prefer to insult the
person inviting them, rather than attend.  The parable does not mention the reasons for non-
acceptance, as they are all personal, and it does not matter in the end, for they miss out on the
feast.  The invited guests are “known by the fruit of their response”.

The host becomes angry with their refusals and sends out his servants to find others to fill the
places at the supper. He sends out two successive parties to get everyone possible to the supper.
In the parable God is the one who prepares the supper. The forthcoming supper is announced by the
prophets and Old Testament Scriptures. Those who go and tell the “respectable” people, in this case
the Jewish leadership, that the meal is ready are John the Baptist and the Lord Himself. They reject
the offer for their own self centred reasons, and they will miss out on all that God had for them.

Those who would have expected to attend God’s banquet had turned Him down, so He had every right to
invite the outcasts of society, whose presence would offend those who had rejected His invitation.
Another wave of invitations are therefore sent out, this time to the less important Jews, the crowds
that follow Jesus around in His ministry and quite a number accept the offer, but there is still not
enough, so a third wave of invitations are sent out, this time to the Gentiles, and this last wave
of invitations brings in another group to the supper and fills the hall.

Therefore the leadership of that generation that received the invitation will not be the ones to
enter into the Kingdom of God, but will eternally have the regret that they walked away form grace,
mercy and eternal peace.

Application
...........

With their different rules regarding man and animals, the Pharisee’s basis of decision making was
exposed as materialistic.  It was clear that making money in the rescue of the animal, which was a
beast of burden, was seen to be much more important than healing a human being, where there is no
economic advantage. Religion is always keen to make money and soon becomes obsessed with either
wealth or power.  It is this aspect of orgnaized religion that betrays its satanic origin.

We need to recognise that we don’t promote ourselves as seen in `1 Peter 5:5-6`, **“Likewise, ye
younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed
with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 6  Humble yourselves
therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:”**

In doing so we will follow the example of Christ in `Philippians 2:5-8`, **“Let this mind be in you,
which was also in Christ Jesus: 6  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God: 7  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was
made in the likeness of men: 8  And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”**

The first resurrection to commendation and blessing occurs in several stages, the Church at the
Rapture of the Church, The Old Testament saints and Tribulational martyrs at the Second Advent of
Christ, and the Millennial saints at the end of the Millennium.

It is the height of foolishness to reject or ignore the offer of God for eternal life, and your part
in the Plan of God. We must not put jobs, materialism or family in front of our relationship with
the Lord. Family ties and social relationships often hinder people from accepting the gospel
invitation.

Requirements Of A True Disciple

Background And Analysis
.......................



.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:25-26
    :bold:

The word hatred here has no implication of emotion it is a case of choosing or holding in higher
esteem. A biblical example would be the case of Esau and Jacob. In `Romans 9:13` it states,** “As it
is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” **`Malachi 1:1-11`. God did not have a
passionate hatred towards Esau, but certainly there is lasting hatred to the religious and political
evils he represented. Rather the key element in this verse is that Jacob had been chosen and
responded in grace, and in that sense God loved him, while Esau had not responded to God’s grace,
except to ignore it, and in that sense God hated him. `Psalm 73:23-26`.

Teachers in Israel regularly demanded great respect, but in the Jewish tradition only God openly can
demand such devotion as Jesus claims here.  This is a clear claim to deity, and all around this area
would have been aware of this and felt very uncomfortable.  That is Jesus’ point; he wants them to
feel discomfort at the claim, and sit with it, in light of the events of the next weeks.  The
resurrection will prove the claim well founded.  He is either to be accepted as “that prophet” who
was Messiah, or he is to be executed!  `Deuteronomy 13:1-11, 18:15-21`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:27
    :bold:

Bearing the cross means to identify with the rejection of Christ. If we are not willing to do this
it will hamper us as a believer from becoming a disciple. The person condemned to die by crucifixion
would carry the horizontal beam of the cross out to the site of the stake where he would be
executed, usually through and surrounded by a jeering mob.

No one would choose this fate for themselves, but Jesus calls true disciples to so put their
devotion towards Him, as to hate their own lives and bear whatever public shame comes to them.  `2
Timothy 1:12, 3:12, 4:6-8`.  Where are our eyes today?  Are they on what the world calls fame and
renown, or upon the eternal rewards that come in Christ Jesus?

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:28-30
    :bold:

Several years before this comment a badly constructed amphitheatre had collapsed in this part of the
Empire with great loss of life due to bad workmanship through lack of funding. This had of course
caused great embarrassment to all involved, and under Roman Law, the execution of the builder. If a
person was going to build a tower or structure obviously the cost of doing so had to be carefully
considered, so that the farce of a half built tower did not occur. To set out to do something and be
stopped by inadequate planning was a great public shame/disgrace.  `Proverbs 24:27`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 14:31-35
    :bold:

Herod Antipas had recently lost a war with a neighbouring Roman client king, so the image of
undertaking a foolish war would still be fresh in the mind of the local Jewish population.  This was
a waste of money and lives, but just normal with power politics and the pride based decision making
for Herod Antipas.

The question here is how much of a person’s resources is he willing to commit to discipleship.
Christ demands all resources. It is a declaration of war against the forces of the enemy, with no
forces held back least defeat be suffered.  Salt losing its savour is the Christian not willing to
be committed to Christ, and therefore not being able to be a true disciple at all.  If salt was
badly stored, rather than being used for its assigned purpose it would not keep, it would go bad and
be useless.  If man does not spend himself for the Lord his hours upon the earth are good for
nothing!

The disciples had done this. They had given up possessions and employment knowing that the message
that Jesus was proclaiming was the most important thing on earth.  They saw all other things as
worthless.

Application
...........

We need to distinguish between discipleship and salvation. They are not the same. For salvation the
requirement is simple faith in trusting that Christ died for our sins, was buried, and rose again.
It is acceptance of him as Lord over all.

Discipleship however includes much more commitment, for the disciple needs to be willing to leave
all, he needs to bear his cross daily, and to count the cost in this life.

When we become a disciple of Christ we need to compute the cost as it is a radical change in
lifestyle which will not be popular with most family and friends unless they themselves are
disciples of Christ.

One’s loyalty to Jesus must come before his loyalty to his family, or even to life itself. Indeed
those who did follow Jesus against their families wishes were probably thought of as hating their
families.

Disciples who do not retain their characteristics of planning and willing sacrifice, like salt that
has lost its savour, are worthless.

Instead of living self centred lives where we count our lives of more importance than the cause of
Christ, we must live a Christ centred life. He has paid for us to be released from the slave market
of sin, and therefore as Paul states we should recognised that we are slaves to Him.
