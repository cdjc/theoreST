Slaughter Of The Galilaeans
---------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:1-5

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:1-3
    :bold:

In most cultures when something bad happened to someone people wondered what the person had done
wrong and whether the disaster was a judgment from a god. Pilate’s cruelty here fits the sort of
conflicts he had with the Jewish community and the presence of a Galilean pilgrims at the holy day
celebrated in Jerusalem. Pilate was present at the festivals to ensure that law and order were
maintained.

The first national calamity was the massacre of some Galileans who had come to Jerusalem to worship.
Pilate the governor of Judaea had ordered them to be killed while they were offering sacrifices.
Nothing else is known concerning this atrocity.  It fits with the character of this man, and by the
time of the Lord’s arrest he is on his “last warning” from Rome due to his violence and evil.  This
massacre simply provides a theological framework for Jesus question.

We assume the victims were Jews who had been living in Galilee. The Jews in Jerusalem might well
have questioned what had happened to them, and have been labouring under the delusion that these
Galileans must have committed terrible sins and that their deaths were an evidence of God’s judgment
on them.  This form of judgment had happened before in Ezekiel’s day and he had foreseen it.  When
the city fell in 586 BC the carnage in the temple was horrific, but when the city fell in 70 AD the
carnage would be worse.  `Ezekiel 9:3-7`.

However the Lord Jesus Christ corrected this by warning the Jewish people that these people were no
more or less evil than any others in the nation, and unless they all repented they would also
perish. In both cases in this passage the Greek word metanoeo, which is translated repent, means to
change your mind. Israel and individual Jews had to change their opinion about Christ. The
subjunctive mood shows that human free will is also involved here.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:4-5
    :bold:

The tower of Siloam may well have been on Jerusalem’s city wall above the pool of Siloam. It might
have been associated with Pilate’s construction of an improved water supply system for the city, as
he built a new aqueduct for the city. The Pool of Siloam is a pool to which Jesus sent the man who
had been born blind. `John 9:7`.  Traces of what appears to be this pool have recently been
uncovered and it is far larger than previously thought. Here the man would have washed and
miraculously received his sight.  `John 9:8-10`.

The other tragedy that Jesus has referred to, that was common knowledge obviously in his day, was
the collapse of this Tower into the pool of Siloam, or around it, which caused the deaths of
eighteen people. Nothing else is known about this accident other than what is recorded here.

Again the point emphasised by the Lord, was that the catastrophe should not be interpreted as a
special judgment for gross wickedness. Rather it should be seen as a warning to all the nation of
Israel that unless they repented a similar doom would come on them. Jesus is saying to these people,
that unless you repent, you will die in the same way with your blood being mingled with animal
sacrifices and towers collapsing around you. Because they didn’t change their minds many of those
present did die in a similar manner.

After a three year siege of Jerusalem in August of 70 AD the Romans broke through the undermined
walls and towers and the walls crumbled and fell, and many Jewish soldiers were killed by the
collapsing towers. The last stand was made within the temple compound. The Roman soldiers finally
broke into the temple compound towards the time of the evening sacrifice as the animals were being
killed. Thus the blood of the animals was literally mingled with the Jewish soldiers and priest’s
blood. They perished in like manner because they refused to repent, to change their minds about
Christ.

The doom came to pass in AD 70 when Titus destroyed Jerusalem and the surviving Jews were scattered.
This could have been avoided if as a nation Israel had turned to the Lord.

Application
...........

In our days we see many catastrophes. We see tsunamis, earthquakes, and epidemic disease, all of
which can end the life of many people in a very short time. What this should teach us is that we are
on this earth for a short period of time and that we cannot guarantee tomorrow. We know that the
Lord has things for believers to do but if we fail to respond to God’s guidance we may be taken home
early as a result of being a poor ambassador for Christ.  Deaths happen – and they happen every day
– and we have security on this earth only in the will of God for us.

Application of an objective view of life is that if we walk with the Lord, even though some things
may be very difficult, all things will work together for good of those who love God, to those who
are the called according to His purpose. Let us therefore follow the Lord Jesus Christ very closely
during the time he allows us to be in His service on earth.

We should not assume that when bad things happen to individuals, or groups of people, that it is
discipline for gross sin. We can learn from such catastrophes, that we are all here for a short time
and that each moment is precious.  `Psalm 68:20, 116:15`.

It is only in this life that we can earn everlasting rewards for eternity. We need to ensure that we
are efficient servants of the Lord and following His direction to optimize the opportunities of
being blessed in this life and in the life to come.

Parable Of Barren Fig Tree
--------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:6-9
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:6-9
    :bold:

Vineyards in the Middle East at the time of Christ often contained fruit trees as well as grapes.
Just because a fig tree did not bear fruit in a given year did not mean that they were necessarily
barren. In this parable the worker asks his master to wait until the fourth year before cutting down
and destroying the fig tree, just to really make sure it is a worthless tree.

The fig tree here is the nation Israel which has been planted in God’s vineyard. God has looked for
fruit from His tree but has found none. The vine dresser or pruner is the Lord Jesus Christ who has
been ministering in Israel for about three years of ministry with little production.  `John
15:1-17`.

The pruner, a worker in the vineyard says that he might dig around the tree and might manure the
tree, the potential for both actions being shown in the subjunctive mood of Skapto, to dig, and
Ballo, to throw [dung], in verse 8. The subjunctive mood may also reflect the fact that manuring a
fig tree was not standard practice, as fertilising fig trees did not usually occur.  He is in fact
pleading for the fig tree to have another chance and ensuring that there is nothing wrong with the
soil before destroying the tree.  `Psalm 80:8-14, Isaiah 5:1-7, 28:7-13, Jeremiah 14:7-9`.

Application
...........

The parable shows that judgment comes on those who do not repent. Here Jesus took the thought one
stage further and noted that fruit must be present.  `Matthew 3:7-10, Luke 8:15`.

A visible change should be seen in the life of a person who has trusted in Christ. If there is no
visible change that person like the fig tree which bears no figs is judged. As leaders in the church
we need to be fruit inspectors.  `Matthew 7:13-23`.

The Lord Jesus pleads for the nation Israel to be given more time to produce fruit but in the fourth
year they conspire and kill the Lord of glory. As a result Israel will be judged, the temple
destroyed and the Jews scattered. The fig tree was destroyed because it did not bear fruit.

Healing Infirm Woman On Sabbath
-------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:10-17
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:10-13
    :bold:

Visiting teachers were often called on to speak in synagogues on the Sabbath. Here he is teaching
and comes across an infirm woman. The woman suffered from severe curvature of the spine and had done
so for 18 years. The deformity was so great that she could not straighten herself up at all.  She is
bent over and clearly in distress at her condition that has deteriorated through the years.

We note in this case that he deformed woman made no plea to the Messiah, but he perceived her
condition and in compassion called out to her. He laid His hands on her and immediately the problem
was solved and she was able to straighten up her back, and walk normally.  She immediately is healed
and worships, giving glory to God, for the healing of this condition would not be possible by any
medical means in that day, and even if healed she would have needed long convalescence.  `Psalm
103:1-5, 107:20-22, 118:16-18`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:14
    :bold:

Jesus healed her, and the president of the synagogue is moved with anger, saying that healing on the
Sabbath was not allowed, and that they should come for healing on the first six days of the week,
but not on the Sabbath. He showed a complete lack of compassion to this disabled woman, but also a
strange view of God and the Sabbath. There was no love or concern for the woman, who if she had come
in the previous six days or presumably any other day in the last 18 years the leader would be
totally impotent to help her.

The real attitude of Israel to the Lord Jesus Christ is seen in the attitude of the leader of the
synagogue who objected to a deformed woman being healed on the Sabbath.  Pharisaic rules officially
forbade any healing by a physician on the Sabbath, but the use of prayer for the sick on those days
was a subject for discussion among them.  How pathetic that you could not do good on a day that the
Lord had set aside for worship, to reflect his perfect provision in the creation?

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:15-16
    :bold:

The Lord reminded the religious leader that on the Sabbath they will loose dumb animals, so that
they can be watered. He said that this was hypocrisy, when not allowing a Jewish woman who
apparently was a believer, not to be allowed to be healed on the Sabbath. Jesus points out that a
person is much more important than an animal, and that his “effort/work” to heal with woman was far
less than loosing any animal.

It is also noted by the Lord that the particular curvature of the spine that this woman was
afflicted with was caused to her by Satan. The release of this problem therefore also involved
freeing from demon oppression. Biblical examples of this type of oppression include the illness
suffered by Job, and the thorn in the flesh of Paul, both of which were stated to come from Satan.
The purpose of all three afflictions was for the healing from them to bring glory to God.  Glory to
God was a good “work” to do as part of worship, and the Lord is arguing that healing ministry is
worship and so totally appropriate for the Sabbath Day.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:17
    :bold:

The total hypocrisy and stupidity of the thinking of the religious leaders was exposed here to the
crowd that had seen this miracle. The officials were ashamed while the crowd rejoiced at the sight
of such a great miracle.  The rulers however do not rejoice, they plot, for they would rather have
their rules than God’s power.   How fanatical are we about what is our definition of worship?  Are
we open for God to be glorified by things that we are not used to happening?

It should be noted that our Lord’s emphasis is on the individual woman here, as Jesus is no longer
dealing with the nation of Israel as a whole anymore. All his work form this time on will be with
positive individuals; his major public speeches are now over.

It was common for both Rabbinical and Greek controversy narratives to end with the wise opponent
responding in such a way that he silenced the other side, and so it was here, so the victory of
Jesus would have been very clear to those who observed this incident

Application
...........

The purpose for the miracles, specifically the healing miracles were to show that the Messiah was
present on earth. In our own case while the dramatic nature of solving our problems is not as
visual, as when the Lord was physically present, the resolution of our problems using the power of
the Holy Spirit can impress those who see God acting in and through our life.

We must recognise that in eternity past the Lord knew what problems we would have and the
circumstances of them. We need to understand that Christian suffering has meaning and should be
endured for the glory of God.

Religion and legalism oppresses people whilst true Christianity sets one free. People in places of
authority often have no care for the ordinary people.

We need to be flexible in viewing incidents relating our responses back to the Scriptures rather
than tradition and experience.

People from a religious background not relying on the Scriptures can be among the most vicious of
people, if their pet tradition or experience is violated by a believer relying on grace.

The Grain Of Mustard Seed
-------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:18-19
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:18-19
    :bold:

The mustard seed, for a very small seed, grows to be significant sized shrub/tree. From a very small
beginning it takes on the huge outer proportions over time. There is going to be an abnormal
external growth of this “mystery kingdom”, and the “mystery kingdom” then becomes a resting place
for different kinds of birds.  The birds are Satan’s people and we can be assured by the Lord’s
words that the enemy will always send his best agents into the tree of God.  Satan doesn't put his
best operatives into the local liquor outlet, for he already has people trapped there by alcohol; he
puts his best and most dangerous perverters of truth into churches.

From the first parable, the parable of the Sower, we know that the birds are agents of Satan.
Because within Christendom and within the tree of Christendom you not only have churches which
adhere to the true gospel but also it is the home of many cults which are indeed the agents of Satan
such as the cults, and other groups. They will cause mischief as Satan did to the woman with the
spinal problems, but we are to expect the enemy to “roost” in the tree, and we are to be on our
guard against Satan’s agents.  `James 4:7-9`.

Application
...........

We see from this parable that from very small beginnings very large things can grow. This should
encourage us in the fact that though we are small in number through the power of the Holy Spirit and
under the guidance of the Lord we can grow and assist others by our industry, and our encouragement
of them.  Ministries can grow quickly form very small beginning under the Holy Spirit’s power and
direction.

In relation to the birds in this parable we need to recognize that many groups exist in Christendom
which are both openly cults, and within church denominations themselves, which are not preaching the
truth, and even actively opposing the truth. They may come under a Christian name, they may use the
Bible, but what they interpret from the Bible may be totally contrary to the Word of God.

In Christendom we see the growth of denominations and Christianity has in fact become a huge number
of groups with many different facets. However the older that the denomination is, the more likely it
is to have added significant traditions to the original truth, meaning that even though they are
large, they may fail to represent accurately the mind of Christ.

It is necessary therefore that we search the Scriptures to make sure that we are complying with the
teaching of the Bible.

Parable Of The Leaven
---------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:20-21
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:20-21
    :bold:

Leaven is always a type of evil and the Bible. When God commanded his people to rid their houses of
leaven in `Exodus 12:15` they understood this. If anyone ate what was leavened from the first of the
seventh day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread he will be cut off from Israel.  It was a feats that
reminded them that the enemy sought to adulterate the nation with falsehood, and they were to
cleanse the houses of all leaven.

Jesus warned against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, of the Herodians, and Paul later of
the Corinthians [see doctrine below]. In general leaven means either evil doctrine or destructively
evil pattern of behaviour.

In this parable of the Lord warns against the permeating power of the evil working in the kingdom of
heaven. The meal represents the spiritual food of God’s people while the leaven is evil doctrine.

Application
...........

This shows that throughout Christendom from Pentecost to the Second Advent of Christ there is going
to be false doctrine inserted into the body of truth by devious people, who will “hide” their errors
within the body of truth.

In the case of the Church this will be quite subtle, as the Mystery of Iniquity is working, but not
fully visible. In the Tribulation however there will continue to be false doctrine until the stage
that the whole of Christendom is permeated with it.

It is up to individuals to study the Scriptures, and so to guard themselves against the false
doctrine, and then being a preservative in this degenerating environment by their teaching of the
truth clearly to all who will hear it.

Teaching & Journeying Toward Jerusalem
--------------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:22-35
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:22-24
    :bold:

As our Lord makes His way towards Jerusalem he goes through the settlements prepared by the seventy
disciples. A person asks the Lord as a result of the mass rejection of the message if only a few
will be saved.  Bearing in mind that the people involved are predominantly the Jewish people who
have been guided strongly by the Pharisees, He says that access to the kingdom will be a struggle
for them.  As a result many will fail to enter. It is the “narrow” (straight) gate – the constricted
gate – for there is only one way – Jesus way.  `John 3:15-18, Acts 4:12, 16:31`.

The image of the two ways was common in Jewish and other ancient literature with some texts
stressing that more people would follow the way to destruction, but the general belief of the Jews
was that nearly all Israel would be saved in the time to come. Jesus is challenging them that their
arrogant over-confidence was dangerous, for they had rejected the doorway to the kingdom (him) and
so they could not expect to enter easily.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:25
    :bold:

It was social manners to greet by name and title those persons one knew. To deny knowing where they
came from would imply that they were unknown to the person, or of no significance, and so not wanted
as visitors.  Such an oversight would be a deliberate slight against the “fame” or reputation of the
person rejected.  To not know where someone was from was not to know whether they were “safe” or
dangerous also.

The master of the house rising up could represent the Lord Jesus Christ returning to set up His
kingdom. The reaction of the Lord after the pre Kingdom time has been terminated is parallel to
separation of the sheep and goats in `Matthew 25:31-46`.   He has the right to “close the door” when
the last invitation has been rejected, as it is his door, and salvation is only by his invitation.
Heaven belongs to God and only God decides who enters and the criteria for entry.  The Lord has been
open about the criteria – it is by faith, by grace, not of any human works, but through worship of
the One who gave his all for mankind.  `Ephesians 2:1-12`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:26-27
    :bold:

In the Middle East fellowship around a meal table created a social bonding. In this parable the
people who are trying to enter the house remind the master of the house that they have eaten with
him at the table of fellowship before, and he has taught in their streets, but again access is
refused to them, as they were “workers of iniquity”. These people had relied on human rather than
divine good, and acquaintance rather than genuine relationship. This is not an area where you can
afford to get it wrong, for eternal life or eternal judgment is at stake.

Here the people who have been rejected from the Kingdom have physically eaten with the Lord, and
have listened to his teaching during His earthly ministry, but physical contact is not enough to
save them.   They have not believed in him, nor given themselves over to Him as their Saviour and
King.  They have been associated with him, but never associated themselves as his own; they have not
drawn close enough to have their lives changed, just close enough for people to think they are
involved with him.  His response is chilling – he does not know them!  Whatever they thought they
were doing with him they were fooling themselves and that is a fatal error of judgment in eternal
matters.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:28
    :bold:

Jewish people assumed that God had prepared the eternal kingdom for Israel. They therefore expected
to participate in it with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but are thrown out [Ekballo].
Many of the religious people thought that simple relationship to Abraham gave them automatic right
of entry into heaven.  They had rejected the prophets and the one the prophets spoke of and yet they
felt they could receive a prophet’s welcome!

The weeping speaks of remorse, and the gnashing of the teeth indicates violent hatred towards God.
These two factors represent the action of unbelievers in hell, who apparently can see the patriarchs
in the kingdom of God at that point.  `Luke 16:19-31`. They expected to be there due to their
physical relationship with the Patriarchs not realising that the relationship must be spiritual and
there must be righteousness, not self righteousness.  They had a sense of entitlement and that
arrogance has its origin in Hell itself.  `Isaiah 14:9-18`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:29-30
    :bold:

The exclusion of many of the unbelieving Jews is further emphasised by the implication that Gentiles
from the four corners of the earth shall recline at the banquet in the kingdom, while many Jews do
not attend. This was a great shock to the hearers. The four cardinal directions when used together
means that the people will come from every quarter.  `Psalm 11:1-4, Isaiah 54:3-4, 63:18-20, Malachi
1:11`.

The first are the Jews as they are the initial focus of the Lord, whilst the last are the Gentiles,
whom the Jews considered to be dogs, or barely higher than animals. This shows that it is not your
birth or physical lineage that counts in the Plan of God it is your relationship with God through
faith in Christ.  Arrogance is turned on its head at this time – for what was expected is not what
is delivered.  They have thought they knew the truth, and on that arrogant basis have rejected the
truth, and now pay the terrible price for that rejection.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:31
    :bold:

Whilst the Pharisees appear to be being kind to Jesus at this point their motive is that they want
Jesus to leave Perea and return to Judea where the Sanhedrin will again have jurisdiction. They want
to get Him to a place where they can kill Him themselves.  They may have heard that Herod is trying
to kill him, but it is equally possible that they simply lie to their own purposes.  A warning from
an enemy is a dangerous warning!  `Amos 7:12-17`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:32-33
    :bold:

The Lord’s response shows that he does not fear the wrath of Herod Antipas.  The “fox” here is Herod
Antipas. It will not be Herod Antipas who will kill Jesus although he killed John the Baptist.
Jesus’ death will be in Jerusalem. There is also the intimation of His subsequent resurrection with
His being perfected on the third day. The reply however is in a cryptic form and put in terms which
they cannot understand, but will later make sense to the apostles.

Jerusalem had the unhappy record of being the location where the greatest number of prophets were
murdered, a concept which would again cause a lot of mental anguish to the Jews, which thought of
Jerusalem as the centre of Jewish piety.  These people have their pre-conceptions challenged by the
Lord in every way, for he still seeks their salvation by challenging them to accept truth.

Some people have difficulty that the Lord spoke of a ruler, Herod as a fox, feeling it is not in
conformity with `Exodus 22:28`, **“Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
people”**.  However this action was not evil, it was the absolute truth, for Herod was indeed a fox,
and his end would be that of a rodent.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:34
    :bold:

Jewish tradition stated that the Jew was under the wings of God, and when a Gentile was converted to
Judaism they were brought under the wings of God. `Psalm 17:8, 36:7, 57:1, 91:4`.  The Old Testament
also portrays God as an eagle hovering over its offspring and protecting Israel under its wings and
terrifying Israel’s foes showing God’s love for His people. `Deuteronomy 32:11-12, 33:27-29`.

Here Jesus uses the same concept portraying Himself in role of a hen protecting her young under the
wings but the offspring in this case were rebellious and by implication rejected the protection
offered.  This is the sadness of the offer made that has by this time been rejected by the majority
of the nation.  `Proverbs 1:22-33, Isaiah 30:15-18, Jeremiah 6:14-16, 7:23-26, 44:4-6`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 13:35
    :bold:

The desolation [Aphiemi – abandoned] of the house could represent the destruction of the Temple in
AD 70 or the destruction of the national entity itself. `Psalm 69:25, Isaiah 1:5-9, 5:5-6,
64:10-11`.  The words then quoted by the Lord were sung in acclamation to the Messiah arriving in
Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. [See volume 18 of the Harmony series for fuller details].  They had been
able to read `Daniel 9:24-27` for over 500 years, and so were without excuse for failing to be ready
for the Messiah and responding properly.  They were told what would happen when they failed to act
properly.

The longer term fulfilment of this will be at the Second Advent of Christ when He will pass through
the remnants of the Golden Gate on His way to the Temple.  It is judgment initially, but it is
victory ultimately – the ending is victorious.  `Zechariah 12:10, 11:1-2, 14:2,  Isaiah 40:9-11,
Isaiah 59-63`.

Application
...........

Many people rely on their heritage, customs, good works, ritual and experience, among other things
to gain access to heaven, but the only way to heaven is through a personal relationship with God
through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

Beware of religious people assisting you as a Bible Believing Christian as sometimes they have
ulterior motives and set plans to trap and destroy you.

Each and every Christian has a personal plan controlled by God. We should not be anxious to
represent the Lord Jesus Christ, but simply to do all he has called us to do, as God is in control
of our path.

The Lord will protect the believer, but this relies on the willingness of the believer to want to be
protected by the Lord rather than doing things their own way. Doing your own thing will often cause
a disaster.
