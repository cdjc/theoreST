Plucking Ears Of Corn On The Sabbath
------------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:1-5
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:1-2
    :bold:

The first Sabbath is the one following the recent Passover. The second Sabbath is the one after
that. Here again we see the disciples walking on the paths that crossed through the cornfields.
They are not trampling the new grain, for no-one did that without being assaulted, for grain was
survival in this culture, but there were walking paths through all fields and all Jews were entitled
to “glean” from grains on the borders of fields if they were hungry.  `Leviticus 19:9-10,
Deuteronomy 24:19-22`.

The phrase “rubbing them in their hands” is found only in Luke, and only here in the New Testament.
This was one of the chief offences that the Pharisees objected to, as according to Rabbinical
guidelines it was reaping, threshing, winnowing, and preparing food all at once.   This was never
Moses rule and had been their addition to the Sabbath Laws, and was false in spirit and in letter.
The Pharisees were straining out gnats and swallowing camels!

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:3-4
    :bold:

The Lord’s answer using an incident in David’s life was that the law of the Sabbath was never
intended to forbid a work of necessity. The law concerning the shewbread was never intended to be so
slavishly followed as to permit His people to starve.  The Lord intended to bless his people through
the Mosaic law, not put them in a straight jacket of legalism.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:5
    :bold:

As God gave the Mosaic Law in the first place, there was no better person to be able to interpret it
in a spiritual way and to save it from misunderstanding as the one who gave it.  Once again the Lord
is claiming to be the God who gave the Mosaic Law.

Application
...........

The purpose of the Sabbath was to help man, not to enslave him.

The Sabbath was given to the Jews only and not the Church or the Gentiles.

We have a moment by moment Sabbath by resting in the Lord hour by hour when controlled by the Holy
Spirit.  `Hebrews 4:2`ff.

For us it is the question of best using each day in God’s service, in God’s grace and Holy Spirit
power every moment.

The Lord wants obedience to his Word, not legalism to the rules added by men.

Even though Jesus was with his disciples, He allowed them to be poor.

From this we may learn that poverty is not disgraceful, and that God often allows it for the good of
his people.

We need to trust that He will take care, in some way, that their needs shall be supplied.

Cure On The Sabbath Of The Man With The Withered Hand
-----------------------------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:6-11
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:6-7
    :bold:

The phrase “On another Sabbath”, means that this incident was on a second, but not necessarily the
next, Sabbath.

Luke notes that the Lord entered into a synagogue to teach, and in the synagogue was a man with a
withered hand. Luke as a physician also noted that the hand that was withered was the right hand.
It is this constant precision with Luke that marks him out as such a careful doctor and historian.

Here rather than the active voice in Mark we have the middle voice when talking about watching the
man and Jesus. This shows that the Pharisees were watching Him for their own advantage, or so they
thought. We also see that it is not only the Pharisees but also the Scribes who were present.  These
men are looking at this man as their opportunity to entrap Jesus, who they expect will heal the man.
They expect a miracle, incapable of being done by any ordinary man, and yet they hate the Lord for
the power he clearly and predictably has!  Evil is baffling indeed!

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:8-9
    :bold:

The Lord knew there thoughts, their dark, malicious plans by the question which they asked Him, as
is stated in Matthew, whether it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath-days. In “reply” to their
question, Jesus asked them whether they would not release a “sheep” on the Sabbath-day if it was
fallen into a pit, and also asked “them” whether it was better to do good than to do evil on that
day, implying that to “omit” to do “good” was, in fact, doing “evil.”  The Lord challenges their
false morality, but of course they do not connect their morals to their theology – that is the
satanic nature, and sign of this form of religion!  `James 2:12-26`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:10-11
    :bold:

The middle voice of the verb for “looking around” gives a personal touch to it all.  In Mark we see
it is with anger.

The Lord Jesus Christ now directly proceeds with the miracle and the withered hand is made as good
as his other hand.

The word “madness” shows that they were in a rage which is like madness. The compound word means “no
mind” and is only found once more in the New Testament in `2 Timothy 3:9`.  They literally unhinge
with rage at him out thinking them.

Why were they filled with madness - Probably,

1.      Because he had shown his “power” to work a miracle.

2.      Because he had shown his power to do it “contrary” to what “they” thought was right.

3.      Because by doing it he had shown that he was from “God,” and that “they” were therefore
“wrong” in their views of the Sabbath.

4.      Because he had shown no respect “to their views” of what the Law of God demanded.  He
claimed equality to God and to be superior to Moses, whose Law he was re-interpreting.

Application
...........

We should obey the commands of God, without pausing to examine the question about his ability, and
especially without saying, “that he can do nothing”.  We must remember the promise, “I can do all
things through Christ who strengthens me”.   `Philippians 4:10-13`.

The Pharisees were interested in legalistic ritual not in compassion or morality. We should take
opportunity to do good as opportunities arise to do so.

Pride, obstinacy, malice, and disappointed self-confidence can all combine in producing madness.  As
we think so we will become over time!

Men are often enraged because others do good in a way which “they” do not approve of.

God gives success to others and because He has not complied to “their” views of what is right, and
done it in the way which “they” would have prescribed.  They are enraged, and filled with envy at
people more successful than themselves.

Selection Of Twelve Apostles
----------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:12-16
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:12-13
    :bold:

Jesus spends all night in prayer before choosing the twelve apostles to Israel. Do we choose
carefully with whom we are to work, or are we impulsive?   Prayerful saturation of all decisions
before making them is a basic requirement for all Christian work that is Holy Spirit filled and
directed.

It is noted that as he selected twelve disciples as the core team, that there were many more
disciples than twelve.

It is of interest that in the book of the Revelation the New Jerusalem has twelve foundations,
twelve gates which are twelve pearls, and twelve precious stones.  `Revelation 21:12-21, 22:1-2`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:14-16
    :bold:

See the list and short comments on these apostles in the background comments on `Matthew 10:1-4`
above.

Luke, being the historian here, is considered to give the real name of Judas but because of the
odium attached to that name by the traitor Judas Iscariot both Matthew and Mark give his nickname.
Both Lebbaeus and Thaddeus have connections with the breast and heart in Aramaic. It is noted that
again Judas [not Iscariot] is used in `John 14:22` because of the need to separate the two of the
twelve disciples named Jude.

Application
...........

Without the authority of the Lord man can do nothing in the realm of demonism.

Greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world.  `1 John 4:4`.

A believer cannot be demon possessed because of the everlasting indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

Even the greatest person who has ever lived needed organization and fellow workers to effectively
minister. No man is an island nor is totally self sufficient.

Spiritual gifts in the church are needed for it to function as it should.

Before making major decisions in your life there should be a time of prayer to ensure God’s guidance
is given.

Plot Against Jesus: Great Following By People
---------------------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:17-19
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:17-19
    :bold:

The purpose of the crowds coming to the Lord Jesus Christ was to hear Him, to be healed of their
diseases both physical and demon induced.

DEMON INDUCED ILLNESS

1.      Satan's sphere of operations among mankind. (`Psalm 109:6-`l 3)(a)      Satan blinds mankind
to the truth of the Word of God by means of religion. (v.7)(b)     He has the power to shorten life.
(v8a)(c)      He can remove persons from a place of authority (v 8b)(d)       Satan can kill (v
9)(e) He can persecute children (v 10)(f)     He can remove wealth (v 11)(g)  Satan can turn people
against each other (v. 12)(h)     He can cut off man's posterity to the second generation (v. 13)

2.      Satan as a killer(a)     He has the power of death but only under God’s permissive will.
(`Hebrews 2:14, 15`)(b)        Killed Job's older children (Job I : 1 2, 1:18,19)(c)   Motivated
Cain to murder Abel (`John 8:44`, cf `1 John 3:12`)(d)        Often administers the sin unto death
(`1 Corinthians 5:5`)

3.      Satan as a source of disease

(a)     Was responsible for Paul's "thorn in the flesh", but once again only by permission. (`2
Corinthians 12:7`)(b)   Produced illness in Job (`Job 2:6-8`)(c)        Uses his demons to inflict
diseases (`Matthew 1` 2:22, `Luke 13:16, Acts 10:38`)(d)     Causes certain types of deafness,
dumbness, paralysis and crippling effect by means of demon possession (`Matthew 4:24, 1 2:22, Mark
9:1 7, 18`)(e)     When demon possession causes the affliction, the removal of the demon or demons
produces an instant cure (Matthew I 0: 1, `Mark 1:32-34, 6:1 3, Acts 8:7, 19:12`)

4.      Satan as an instrument of discipline(a) Desired to discipline Peter (`Luke 22:31, 32`)(b)
Was authorised to discipline the Corinthian adulterer (i Corinthians 5:5)(c)    Was called upon by
the Apostle Paul to administer extreme discipline to Hymenaeus and Alexander (i Timothy 1:19,20)(d)
May become involved in the discipline of ministers and deacons (`1 Timothy 3:6, 7`)(e)  Attacks
through a believer's lack of forgiveness and orientation to grace (`2 Corinthians 2:1 0`, II

5.      Satan as a healer(a)    Healing was a temporary spiritual gift before the completion of the
Canon of Scripture (`Acts 19:1 1, 12`, cf Philippians2:27, `2 Timothy 4:20`)(b)     God still heals
today ( `Philippians 2:27`)(c)  Since Satan possesses the power of disease he often counterfeits
healing by the removal of demons (`Matthew 12:24, 24:24, 2 Thessalonians 2:9, Revelation 16:14`)

6.      Characteristics of Demonic Possession(a)        Loss of individuality: the demon-possessed
person no longer has control of faculties of the human soul (`Mark 5:1-1 3, Luke 8:27, 9:39, 40`)(b)
Abnormal behaviour:(i)  Convulsions (`Mark 1` :26, 9:20, `Luke 4:35`)(ii)       Violence (`Matthew
8:28`)(iii)  Abnormal strength (`Mark 5:4, Luke 8:29, Acts 19:16`)(iv)       Raving (`Mark 5:5`)(v)
Foaming at the mouth (`Mark 9:20`)(vi)  Nakedness (`Luke 8:27`)(c)      Loss of health (these may
occur but are not indicative alone of demonism with out the above factors also):(i)   Dumbness
(`Mark 9:1 7, Luke` I 1: 1 4)(ii)      Deafness and dumbness (`Mark 9:25`)(iii)        Blindness and
dumbness (`Matthew 12:22`)(iv)    Epilepsy (`Mark 1:26, 9:20, Luke 4:35`)(v)      Mental illness –
not all by any stretch – in fact a minor proportion (`Mark 5:15`)

Application
...........

At times one stays and takes the fight to others. At other times we withdraw from a place of
conflict; we walk under the Holy Spirit’s guidance alone and then we are safe.

Jesus had the power to heal but His miracles were performed only on those who came to Him for help.

So it is with salvation. Jesus Christ has made a way for every member of mankind to be saved but it
is only for those who seek salvation that it is effective.

We see that Jesus relied on God to guide as to where and when He ministered. We also should be
guided by God as to where and how we are to serve Him.

The Beatitudes
--------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:20-26
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................



.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:20
    :bold:

Here we see the Lord Jesus Christ looking out over his disciples; both the central twelve and the
hundred or more regular followers. This is a direct statement to the disciples as he says “Blessed
be ye poor”, or in more modern English “Blessed be you poor ones”. Jesus chose twelve disciples and
sent them out poor and persecuted to serve humanity.

Again they may have been materially poor but they had realised that they were spiritually deficient
and could only work by grace.  Wickedness may appear to be “blessed” at times, but their end is
always destruction.  `Psalm 37:16-17, 113:6-9, Proverbs 16:19, 19:1-2, Isaiah 29:19-20, 57:15-18,
Zephaniah 3:12, Zechariah 11:11-13`.

These wicked and wealthy people are unlikely to respond to the gospel and be saved however those who
are poor and have a more realistic viewpoint of themselves and the future, may respond to the gospel
and become converted. It is for them that the Kingdom of God exists; that is for those who respond
to the message.  `James 1:9-12`.

The disciples also went out materially poor, having to rely on the Lord and the Lord’s people to
sustain them. If they had gone out rich many might flock to the banner on the basis that they might
themselves get rich.  The Lord did not ever preach a prosperity gospel message, and it is always a
danger to truth – it comes from the enemy.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:21
    :bold:

The second and third beatitudes are contrasted with the present state and that in the future. The
contrast is heightened by the adverb “nun” which means right now or in the present.  Here we see the
disciples hungering after the Lord and his work to perhaps their physical detriment only to be
satisfied fully by the result or weeping which by the Lord is turned into joy.  `Psalm 42:1-2,
63:1-7, 65:4, 143:3-6, Isaiah 44:3-8, 55:1-3`.

The word filled was originally used for giving fodder (chortos) to animals, but here it is spiritual
fodder or food, and the result of taking in spiritual food is always joy, even in the most difficult
places and times.  `Psalm 6:6-9, 126:5-6`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:22-23
    :bold:

For the Christian there will be both separation and ostracism at times from the world, but
incredible fellowship in the Spirit with those who love the Lord as we do. The reference here is to
excommunication from the local synagogue congregation as well as from social interaction and
financial dealings. This was sacrifice and a social penalty for standing for the name of Christ then
as there is today in many places.

In the phrase “Cast out your name as evil”, the verb is used in Aristophanes, Sophocles, and Plato,
of hissing an actor off the stage. The name of “Christian” or disciple or “Nazarene” came to be a
byword of contempt as shown in the Acts.  Jesus foretold what will befall those who are loyal to him
in the days to come. The Acts of the Apostles is a commentary on this prophecy.

The phrase “Son of Man” is Christ’s common designation used even by Jesus of himself. The only other
passages where Jesus is referred to as the Son of man is the case of Stephen in `Acts 7:56`, and
John’s reference to Him as such in `Revelation 1:13` and 14:14.

Both Son of God and Son of man apply to him. `John 1:50,52, Matthew 26:63`. Christ was a real man
though the Son of God. He is also the representative man and has authority over all men.  Jesus says
that this action of persecution will be common practice for unbelievers in all of history and cites
what the Jews did to their prophets. The Greek word Poieo translated “did” in verse 23 is in the
imperfect tense, which means that they kept on doing it. `Hebrews 11:32-39`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:24-26
    :bold:

Here we see people who are seeking wealth as the primary goal in life, others seeking self
satisfaction, seeking mirth only, seeking power over others, and seeking a reputation. How well this
reflects the state of attitude that is dominant today.  People still chase after the things that do
not last into eternity, and few seek the things that matter eternally.

People who do not realise that they are spiritually destitute do not see the need for salvation.
They are like the Laodicean church in `Revelation 3:14-18`,  **“And unto the angel of the church of
the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of
the creation of God; 15  I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert
cold or hot. 16  So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out
of my mouth. 17  Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing;
and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: 18  I counsel
thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou
mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with
eyesalve, that thou mayest see.”**

It is of interest that the rich Pharisees and Sadducees were the chief opposers of Christ, as of the
early disciples later [`James 5:1-6`]. The verb “apecho” from evidence from papyri shows that it
means “received in full”. The word “consolation” is the Greek word “Parakaleo” to call alongside, to
encourage, help and comfort. The rich have been comforted by their riches, but that is all the
comfort that they will receive – they have eternity to regret their short sighted choices.  `Isaiah
14:9-11`.

The results of this short sighted comfort however are seen in the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus
where the rich man has received comfort in his physical life and rejected or ignored spiritual
opportunities. The result is that the Rich Man is to spend eternity in the Lake of Fire. `Luke
16:19-31`.

The unbelievers have all their good things and happiness here and now, in perishable objects. In the
future their inward craving will be as strong as ever, but the materials of satisfaction will have
gone forever.  We also see the danger of flattery or taking too much notice of what pleasing things
others tell you. Jesus points out that their fathers did the same things to the false prophets. They
spoke well of false prophets. `Isaiah 30:8-11, Jeremiah 5:23-31`.

In addition if you are doing a proper job with witnessing you will not be universally popular, as
the Cross and the gospel is an offence to the unsaved.  `Romans 5:15-20, Galatians 5:11`.  If you
are receiving universal commendation you may be acting as a false prophet.

Application
...........

You can search for the rest of your life for inner happiness but you can only find it if God does
the work and you accept His work and walk in his path for you.

If you have comfort or not during times of testing depends on your understanding and application of
doctrine to your life at the time of suffering.

The major problem in the Christian life is negative attitude towards God’s provision and/or
ignorance of that provision.

If one pursues the Lord through reading and applying the Scriptures they will be spiritually
satisfied.

If you do not know Biblical principles you cannot think grace.

There are real dangers in wealth and being surrounded with plenty as it brings physical comfort and
can make us unconcerned about spiritual or eternal matters.

By listening to the flattering words of others one can be distracted from seeking the Lord as one
can feel self supporting and have the attitude “I did it my way” whereas in order to have a
relationship with God we have to do it His way.

Are we observable seen the children of God because of our work for the Lord and our attitude towards
people?

Application Of The Law

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:27-36
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:27-31
    :bold:

Jesus now unveils a dramatic concept which was completely foreign to the teachings of the day, the
concept of loving your enemies and doing good to those who hate you. This was to be one of the most
effective weapons in evangelising the world. This concept required supernatural power, the power of
God.  `Exodus 23:2-5, Proverbs 21:21, 29-31`.

The reason the religious leaders advocated hating your enemies, was because they being generally
unregenerate, could do nothing else, and so they made their necessity a virtue.  An unbeliever
loving ones friends or family mainly comes from the emotions while the loving of your enemies comes
from the use of the will when motivated and empowered by God alone, or by a very strong
philosophical belief system from the Old Sin Nature area of strength.

The attitude of unconditional love is now examined under a series of examples which have been dealt
with under the evaluation of the Matthew passage above.  Love had always ben at the heart of the
Mosaic law, for the purpose of the Law was to drive The Jewish people to their knees to seek the
Lord’s strength and power to serve as the Lord required.  `Deuteronomy 15:7-11, Psalm 41:1, Proverbs
3:25-28`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:32-34
    :bold:

Luke also points to the fact that unsaved men can love those who love them. Whatever is able to be
done by the unsaved is clearly not the believer’s way of life!  This is a natural behaviour and so
common that it makes no impression on unsaved man. Banks and other lending institutions can loan
money but expect it to be repaid with interest. This does not require divine life.  God requires
more of us than the banks.  `Leviticus 25:35-38, Psalm 37:26, Matthew 5:20`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:35-36
    :bold:

Jesus now repeats his command to act as God does towards His enemies by doing good in the face of
evil for such actions will show your relationship to God and contrast greatly with worldly habits.
`Romans 5:8-10, 2 Corinthians 8:9`.

He says that such action will mark you in the sight of the world as children of God. This is a
manifestation of the life which often can be far more powerful than of the words and our lives
should complement our words and not contrast with what we say.

The word mercy means grace in action. God always acts with us in grace and we should show grace
towards others. This does not mean that we should be passive in the face of tyranny, but our life
should be characterised by agape love.`Ephesians 4:31, 5:1-2, 1 Peter 1:15-16`.

Application
...........

It is possible to become involved in sin even though one is innocent, as in the case of the
adulterous situation the Lord will describe, when one partner was not aware of a previous marriage
of the other. Due to the sin of one person others can be affected.

It is important to break out from the bond of sin, and this can be done by three steps; firstly
confession, where we come back into fellowship with God, then secondly we need to forget our
forgiven sin, and then isolate our tendency to repeat it.

We should not make God, or any other person our co signer, but understand that we are responsible
for our own statements as an ambassador for Christ.

If you retaliate when in conflict with others on the basis of an eye for an eye and tooth for a
tooth you lower yourself to the level of the person who has wronged you and you have lost your
testimony.

You can only be perfect like God is perfect by being controlled by the Holy Spirit and producing the
fruit of the Spirit.

We are commanded to treat others in grace using as an example the way that God has treated believers
and unbelievers alike in grace.

Judging Others

    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:37
    :bold:

There are two things that agape, Holy Spirit filled love, does not do; it does not judge from any
perspective of arrogance, nor does it condemn as if it has the power to punish wrongdoing. We are
not to judge another person’s motive, for we cannot read his mind so we cannot know why a person
acts as he does.  The Lord has ordered us to be “fruit inspectors” of people’s spiritual/carnal
works if there is any danger, but we are not to act as judge and jury over any person.  We inspect
fruit to keep ourselves safe from evil workers, but even then we don't judge them, we just avoid
them.  `Matthew 7:13-23`.

We must not judge another person’s stewardship as God is the judge in all such cases. `Romans
14:1-10, 2 Corinthians 5:9-19, James 4:11-12`.   `1 Corinthians 4:1-4`. “Let a man so account of us,
as of the ministers of Christ, and  stewards of the mysteries of God. 2  Moreover it is required in
stewards, that a man be found faithful. 3  But with me it is a very small thing that I should be
judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 4  For I know nothing by
myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he  that judgeth me is the Lord.”

If we do not forgive we will be under the control of our own Old Sin Nature, and will be filled with
bitterness or other sins of the mind. We need to treat people in grace, so we can have the gift of
forgiveness by grace. We cannot walk in fellowship with God if we have unconfessed sin in our life.
`Psalm 37:1-13, 23-28`.   We keep ourselves safe from make believers and fakes who threaten us, or
the innocent, but we leave justice to the Lord, for the Lord alone knows the heart of all mankind.
`1 Corinthians 13:4-7, Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 3:12-13`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:38
    :bold:

Christian ministry is one of giving, the giving of oneself for the benefit of others and the glory
of God. It is a rule in the Christian life that those who give generously will be rewarded openly
with spiritual blessings, but those things we keep back and don't share we lose eventually.   `Psalm
18:25-26, 41:1-2, Proverbs 3:9-10, 10:22, 19:17, 22:9`.

The phrase “give into your bosom” is a picture of a sower with an apron which has a large pocket on
the front. In this he keeps the seed he is to sow. It is close to his chest or bosom. The sower
takes the seed from his apron pocket and broadcasts it liberally across the paddock or field and as
a result he harvests a great crop so large that his pocket is unable to hold it all. If however he
sows sparingly his return is much lower. `2 Corinthians 9:6-11`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:39-40
    :bold:

A parable is a story which all can understand, but only those who are spiritual believers can
understand the spiritual meaning behind the story.   `1 Timothy 6:3-5, 2 Timothy 3:13`.

We cannot give what we have not got ourselves.  If we are blind to certain of the truths of God’s
word we are unable to assist others in those particular areas. If there are blind spots in our
understanding there will also be blind spots in our explanations, and so those whom we are trying to
assist will have inadequate information given to them.

The word master in verse 40 is the Greek word “didaskalos” which means teacher. This verse is saying
that a person cannot teach what he does not know. He cannot lead his students to a higher level than
he has attained, and if he is confused he can only spread confusion.  If he has a fatal flaw in his
knowledge he will lead all he teaches into disaster.

The more he teaches them the more they become like him. The person who is trained eventually has the
same knowledge as his teacher providing the teacher does not retain certain knowledge for his own
use and not share it.  The danger here is not that the teacher is malicious, just that they are
ignorant of key facts.  They do not mean to mislead, but they do not understand key things, and so
their disciples are limited in their grasp of the truth also.  Now there have been misleading and
malicious prophets down the years, but it is ignorance and blindness to truth that is danger –
irrespective of any malice.  `Jeremiah 14:15-16, Micah 3:6-7, Zechariah 11:15-17`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:41-42
    :bold:

This section is dealt with in some detail in `Matthew 7:1-5` above. This shows a person cannot
assist another if he has a similar sin problem which he has not dealt with. Often we are aware of
other’s shortcomings without addressing our own and if ours are in a similar area then our very
perspective on the problem will be warped by our sinful and blinded thinking.  Sin blinds us to
truth, as our Old Sin Nature covers its own tracks, and doesn't recognize sin that is in ourselves.
`Psalm 50:16-22, 51:9-13`.

Each individual sin nature has a different trend in sinning. It could be pride, arrogance, worry,
anger, deceit, judging or a number of other areas. Often the person is blind to those areas where he
is weakest, but very aware of others shortcomings in his area of strength.  This is why people who
steal can look down on those who are physically violent, and why fornicators may be arrogant towards
fraudsters, and yet are equally guilty before the Lord.

Application
...........

We individually are responsible to the Lord for our sins and are answerable to Him.

We get out of the trap of judging by -

[1] Confessing of our sin of judgment. `1 Corinthians 11:31`.

[2] By that means we are controlled by the Holy Spirit and we now have a mental attitude of love.
`Galatians 5:16`

[3] We need to mind our own business and live our own life before the Lord. `Matthew 7:1-5`

[4] We should then become occupied with the person of Christ. `Hebrews 12:2`

[5] Having a thorough knowledge of sin from a biblical viewpoint. `Proverbs 6:16-10`

[6] We need to be orientated to the grace of God. `2 Peter 3:18`

We are not to evaluate for condemnation the works of another believer.

[1] Leave evaluation and discipline in the hands of the Lord.

[2] If another believer has wronged you place the matter of retribution in the Lord’s hands. `1
Peter 5:7 Psalm 55:22, Romans 12:19`.

[3] The believer has enough problems in his own life without meddling in the life of another.
`Romans 14:4`

[4] The legalist is prone to judge the grace man. `Galatians 4:29`

[5] The legalist is in no position to judge others due to his reliance on his attitudes to criticise
others.

[6]. Exceptions to the above

[a] The believer with doctrinal maturity is applying Biblical principles to another person or
organisation where the situation is detrimental to the cause of Christ.

[b] The pastor of a church has the authority to judge under certain circumstances but you cannot
judge unless you know all the facts.

[c] As a member of a committee reviewing a person to hold office.

[d] Writing a recommendation for another person.

All that we have is the Lord’s. We come with nothing, and we go with nothing. If we sow generously
we harvest well and the Lord is glorified thereby.

It is of the utmost importance that the Christian teacher does not retain information for his own
private use and professional advantage as many leading academics do.

As a teacher we should try and teach our students to a stage where they know as much as we do at an
early age so that in the future under their own improvements they can become superior to their
teacher.

We have to ensure we do not join groups who have similar trends in their sin natures so that we
become critical of others who have weaknesses in another area in which we would never fail. For
instance a person who has a tendency to outbursts of anger can be very critical of a person who
worries and vice versa.

Background And Analysis

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:43-45
    :bold:

The fourth illustration the Lord uses is the tree and its fruit. A tree bears fruit, good or bad
depending on its character. So it is in service. Some will produce good things, others bad.  A
mature Christian controlled by the Holy Spirit can bring blessings to others as he or she ministers
to others. People will see Christ in their lives and they will be noticeably different to their
pagan neighbours.  `Psalm 92:12-14, Isaiah 5:4, 61:1-3, Matthew 7:13-23, Titus 2:11-14`.

On the other hand an unbeliever or carnal believer will bring a non Christian attitude to a
situation. The Christian should be noticeably different, not by what he says so much as what he
does. The testimony of the life is greater than the testimony of the lips, or at least the former is
a pre requisite for effectiveness in the latter.

Application
...........

We need to be aware of false teachers. It is of extreme importance that we compare all that we hear
with the Scriptures to ensure that we are not led astray.

The leaders in the church must be fully aware of apostates and others who could problems within the
church by the teaching or promotion of false doctrines.

We are to be fruit inspectors. By their fruit you will recognise them. Good fruit can only come from
good trees.  We are not judging, or condemning them, we are just being safe and avoiding the
contamination of false doctrine and false lives.

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:46
    :bold:

The word Lord means master and means that He has complete authority over our lives, that we belong
to Him and we are obligated to do whatever He says.  It is genuine respect that the Lord requires of
us, not the form of words that indicates respect but is actually hypocrisy. `Malachi 1:6, Matthew
7:21-23, 24:44-51`. True love and faith involves obedience and we really do not love him if we do
not do what he says. `John 15:4-17`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 6:47-49
    :bold:

To further enforce this truth the Lord gives the story of two builders. Whilst this can be
considered one of salvation the believer and the unbeliever, it can also be applied to two types of
believer, the first being the spiritual believer who bases his actions on Christ and walks generally
in accordance with the plan of God. `1 Corinthians 3:12-14`.

The other is the carnal believer who believes that Jesus is genuinely who he claims to be, but does
not follow God’s plan for his life.  So when problems arise his life becomes a disaster and it
causes all types of problems to all around him. He could well be the person referred to by Paul in
`1 Corinthians 3:15`, who is a believer who did not produce works of lasting value and has no
rewards but is saved, but through fire.  `Romans 14:10-13, 2 Corinthians 5:6-11`.

In either case it is a reminder for the Christian that there is only one true life that has good
results, and that is one lived under the power of the Holy Spirit, and therefore in conformity with
the plan of God, and in obedience to the Word of God.  We are either built upon the rock that is
Christ, or we are on the shifting sands of men’s opinions and theologies.  All that man builds is
swept away in time, but all that God the Holy Spirit builds into the life have results that last
forever.

Application
...........

Eternal Life exists only in Christ. To have life you must receive the one who is Life Himself (John.
1:4, 14:6; 1 John. 5:11-12).  If you reject Him, you actually condemn yourself to eternity in the
Lake of Fire with Satan who rejected his authority before man was made. The decision is your own;
what will you do with Jesus Christ for salvation and then for service?

Not all miracles or great works which are done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are from him.
They can be from a human or satanic background. Satan is the great counterfeiter. Look at the fruit
in the person’s life and ask is it good?

Christianity is a relationship, not a religion, nor a form of works which manipulate the truth.

Bible doctrine is exact, categorical, and absolute, providing it is rightly divided, as its author
is God.
