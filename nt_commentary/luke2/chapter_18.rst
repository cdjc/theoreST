Parable Of The Widow And The Judge

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:1-5
    :bold:

This is a good example of a good principle being shown, using the bad actions of a corrupt and lazy
judge. Under Old Testament Law judges were to fear God, and therefore defend the oppressed. Many
ancient societies had severe legal penalties for unjust judges.  Irrespective of the laziness of the
judge, the woman is persistent with her petition, and even though it is from the wrong motives, he
finally does justice, just to end the aggravation she creates by her constant requests.

The widow was an excellent example of the oppressed poor, as they could be destitute and therefore
exploited. She certainly could not afford to bribe anyone. The principle is that with persistence in
approaching the judge who could not care less either for the law or people results could be
obtained.  How much more will man obtain justice and righteousness from the Lord, who is both
Righteous and Just.  `Psalm 55:16-17, 20-23, 65:1-2, 86:1-7, 102:17-18, 142:1-7, Isaiah 1:10-20,
Jeremiah 29:11-14`.

Initially the judge refused to hear the case, not being interested in it from a judicial point of
view, but eventually decided to hear it, so that he would not get worn out by her constant
complaining. Here persistence enabled her to get a judgment in her favour.   God encourages us with
persistence, knowing his character, and testing ours in the process. It is by building patience
within us that our Christian character is formed in fullness.  `Romans 8:24-28, James 1:3-4,
5:7-11`.

Prayer is based firmly upon the certainties of the character of God, but prayer is dialogue, not
monologue, and we seek the Lord’s answer, and we must wait upon the Lord at times for a long time,
as we see his plan unfold.  Prayer is about his will being worked out, and our working out what that
is through time, as we wait upon His Throne.  `Psalm 37:7-9, 130:1-5, Hebrews 4:12-16`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:6-8
    :bold:

This is quite a common concept in life to see a believing man doing certain things, and then God
doing that much more. Here Jesus says that if the unjust judge will give justice, how much quicker
and better will the justice be when provided by a loving God who is keenly interested in His
children.  `Psalm 9:8-10, 10:12-18, 54:1-7, Jeremiah 20:10-13, Hebrews 10:32-39`.

The elect here may well relate to the Jewish remnant in the Tribulation, but the principle here is
also true of all believers in any age. The reason He has not intervened before is because He is
longsuffering with men, not willing that any should perish. `2 Peter 3:9`.  The only reason there is
not an answer seen to believing prayer in accordance with the will of the Lord is that the answer is
due, but has not yet come; it is however as certain as the character of God is certain.

It was commonly predicted by the Bible, and Jewish writers generally, that there would be great
suffering because many people will fall away from the truth. We are instructed to stand firm.  The
words of verse eight contain the sad truth that many will fall away as the days darken, but the
challenge is to stand like Noah and others, in the faith that reflects the truth about God’s person,
his power, and his plan being certainties.  `Habakkuk 2:2-4, 3:17-19, 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3, 2
Thessalonians 2:8-12, James 5:1-8, 4:6-10`.

Application
...........

God is faithful to act on behalf of and to vindicate His people particularly at his final judgment
day. The certainty of things to come, both the disasters predicted, and the victory of the Lord,
should motivate us in our prayers.

Jesus points out that if an unrighteous judge responds as a result of persistence, how much more
will God respond to the cries of His children.

When the Lord does return He will do so swiftly, and His judgment will rain down on those who have
persecuted believers and rejected God’s grace.

God cares for all his children. Those who attack believers do so at their peril because judgment
will fall on them.

Parable Of The Pharisee And Publican
------------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:9-14
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................



.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:9-12
    :bold:

Whilst the Pharisee was going through the motions of prayer, he was not really addressing God, but
using his public prayers as a platform for boasting about his religious activities to those present
in the Temple Courts.  This was a common practise of these people, for often when they were about to
donate some money to a beggar the small band which accompanied them would strike up a tune to
attract the attention of those in the vicinity that he was giving alms.

In his statement the Pharisee praises his own activities whilst denigrating those of the tax
collector. He notes the fact that he tithes everything as well as giving alms. The Pharisees fasted
on Mondays and Thursdays even going without water. They were extremely self disciplined, and totally
self satisfied.  This man is “good” as far as the rules of the Mishnah were concerned, for he did
all he could do, but his heart was far from his fellow man, and from God.  This man believes that
God is blessed by having him on the divine team!

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:13
    :bold:

The attitude of the tax collector is in stark contrast to that of the Pharisee. He realises very
clearly that he is a sinner who has fallen far short of the glory of God. In fact he is so despised
by the rest of society that the only social activity he normally has is with other isolated and
ostracized sinners or prostitutes. Rather than boast about what he has done he humbly throws himself
on the mercy of God, and he is assured by scripture, from one end to the other, that he will be
heard and accepted by a Merciful God.  `Psalm 51:1-11, 103:1-14, 106:6, 107:1-7, 1 John 1:5-10`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:14
    :bold:

A review of the Greek in this verse shows that Jesus says [Present tense of Lego he keeps on
saying], that this man, the publican/tax collector, went down to his home, at a point in time
[Aorist tense of Katabaino], having received justification in the past with the results that go on
forever [Perfect Passive Participle of Dikaioo].

The action of the participle of Diakaioo precedes the action of the main verb, which in this case is
Katabaino, to go down. The tax collector received permanent justification prior to descending to his
house from the Temple.  There is certainty in his justification, for there is certainty in the
character of God, and God forgives absolutely and totally.  `Psalm 138:6-8, Proverbs 3:31-35, 15:33,
16:16-19, 18:12, 29:23, Isaiah 2:10-17, 1 Peter 5:5-10`.

The verse continues, stating that all having lifted themselves up [Present Active Participle of
Hupsoo], will receive in the future abasement [Future Passive Indicative of Tapeinoo], and ends with
an exact mirror image of genuine self humbling resulting in receiving lifting up.

Application
...........

This famous parable shows clearly the attitude of God towards pride, bearing in mind that the worst
sin on God’s list of sins is pride.

We cannot work for salvation, but God has done all the work through the Lord Jesus Christ. What God
requires is a humble spirit and a willingness to be subject to the plan of God.

Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled but he who humbles himself will be exalted in God’s
time. `1 Peter 5:5-6` says,  **“Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of
you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth
grace to the humble. 6  Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
you in due time”.**

The perfect tense of justify shows that God’s works are permanent. At salvation God gives you a
large number of benefits which are yours forever.

Christ Blesses Little Children
------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:15-17
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:15-17
    :bold:

The Lord here builds on the parable by the use of the children’s presence in the crowd, who the
disciples try to send away.  Don't criticize the disciples here, for they know that something very
important is being communicated and they fear that the children will distract things, but the
opposite is the case. Here we see that the humility like that of a little child is necessary for
entrance into the kingdom of God. Mothers and others crowded around the Lord Jesus Christ with their
children looking for an opportunity for the Lord to bless the children.

The disciples saw this as an unnecessary distraction by people who were not of great importance, and
by so doing were starting to err as the Pharisee in the parable erred. The disciples themselves are
rebuked by the Lord, who tenderly calls the children to him. It is noted that Luke notes that they
brought infants in verse 15 [Greek word Brephos] as well as young children [Paidion in verse 16].
He has the doctor’s precision as to the various ages involved as he makes the point that all
children are precious in the Lord’s sight, and their attitude of humility is to be copied by the
adults.  `Psalm 131` :1-2.

The Lord clearly states that we have to have faith like a small child to enter heaven. It cannot be
done by rationalism or empiricism as they have human merit, but by grace, through faith we are
saved, not of works lest any man should boast. Not by works of righteousness that we have done but
by His mercy He saved us.  `John 10:9, Acts 4:12, 16:30-31, Romans 10:9-13, Ephesians 2:5-8, Titus
3:5`.

Application
...........

God’s kingdom is not achieved by human merit or achievement, and it must be received as God’s gift
by simple trust in God, by those who recognise that they are unable to achieve it in any other way.

Little children do not need to become adults to be saved but adults need to have a simple faith and
humility of a child to enter into a living relationship with God.

The Lord blesses the children in a very warm hearted way, and shows what love He shows to those who
do things in God’s way.

This also indicates what happens to young children if they die, they go to be with the Lord.

Children can come to a saving knowledge of the Lord at an early age. The age when a child becomes
aware of God and can respond to the gospel varies due to a number of factors but mainly due to the
environment the child is brought up in.

The absolute necessity of child evangelism is seen here.

The Rich Young Ruler
--------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:18-30
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:18-19
    :bold:

The rich young ruler here may even have been a member of the Sanhedrin. Being rich according to the
dogma of the Pharisees he was considered to be subject to divine favour, and therefore already
guaranteed entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven. He however realises there is something missing, and
he knew it to be spiritual, but did not suspect that it was also his materialism until the Lord puts
his finger on this man’s deeper lust pattern – wealth itself.

Being Jewish, the Lord Jesus Christ likes to answer questions by asking a question. What He says
here is, Why are you calling me good, for there is no one good except God. If the rich young ruler
had answered the question by saying that he thought Jesus was God, the young ruler would have owned
the Lord, and have had eternal life. However he did not accept Jesus Christ as God, so Jesus tries
to demonstrate to him that he is a sinner and needs Him as his Saviour.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:20-21
    :bold:

Of the Ten Commandments or Decalogue, Jesus chooses commandments which relate man’s relationship
with other members of the human race to pinpoint this man’s area of weakness and his need to
confront his need for a true Saviour. In general living a moral life, the rich young ruler indicates
that he considers he has kept these commandments since the time of accountability, the time of his
youth. He apparently was a model citizen, and the Lord will not challenge him; this man is a truly
honest and good man, not a hypocrite like the Pharisee of the earlier parables.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:22-23
    :bold:

The problem for the rich young ruler is that the commandments, which relate to his relationship with
God, which are the first four of the ten, are the ones in which he has failed.   He has not seen
this until the point that Jesus challenges him, but the Lord puts his finger firmly here and presses
hard!  This is mainly in the area of making his god of wealth more important in his life than his
relationship with God. He therefore has abrogated the first commandment, which states that God must
be pre eminent in ones life. If you fail in one commandment you fail in all. `James 2:10`.

As God is perfect, it is necessary to follow Jesus, and do everything God’s way in order to obtain
everlasting life. To test his free will the Lord now commands the rich young ruler to sell all he
has and distribute the results to the poor. As this is directly affecting the central focus of his
life, to hold onto what he has accumulated, he feels very sad and departs from the Lord’s presence.
He is not ready to walk away from the wealth he can see, and win eternal life that he cannot see,
especially when his Pharisee friends tell him he is acceptable anyway. `Proverbs 11:28, 18:11,
30:9`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:24-27
    :bold:

The problem is not wealth itself the problem is trusting in that wealth for security. Wealthy people
have this drawback which is best seen when they lose it. The Lord comments that it is extremely
difficult for a wealthy man to become a believer, because he is cushioned from many problems by his
assets.  The camel going through the “needle’s eye” is the picture of getting an animal into the
city after the main gate was closed – it is possible, but only by totally unloading the camel of all
its goods first – and then with lots of pulling and pushing get the camel through the small gate.
The Lord’s point is that this man has to “unload” his soul of its dependence on wealth to secure
anything eternally, or he will have nothing eternally.  It is grace alone – no works or wealth will
help him – God alone can do it for him, and seeks his bowed knee to achieve this.  `Ephesians
2:1-10, Philippians 3:7-16`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:28-30
    :bold:

In reply to Peter’s comment, Jesus tells the disciples that those who follow the Lord will be
blessed in many ways, not only in this life, but also in the life to come. It is however critical to
make the decision to follow the Lord as a top priority in the life, whatever is required, even if it
means letting go of financial security and using assets to the glory of God rather than feeling they
are secure.  In the earthquakes that have wrecked cities in New Zealand in the years 2010-2013 we
have all had lessons in this, for many felt they were secure, with investment properties and money
in the bank and finance company investments in “blue chip” securities.  All were swept away in a few
months.

Application
...........

The most difficult people to reach for the Lord Jesus Christ are religious, and self righteous
people, as well as rich people. The rich people depend on their wealth and its influence, and self
righteous people are depending on their good works.

No one was ever saved by keeping the Law. No one could keep the Law other than Christ as the rest of
humanity have old sin natures.

Every member of the human race has an Old Sin Nature, which has various areas of activity; there is
an area of weakness which produces sins and an area of strength which produces human good.

This good is however not acceptable to God as its source is a sinful human nature. `Titus 3:5,
Ephesians 2:8,9`. The only form of good which is acceptable is divine good produced using God’s
power and His Plan.

In `Romans 3:20` it says that by the keeping of the law no flesh or no members of the human race
shall be justified for by means of the law is the knowledge of sin. Also see `Romans 3:28, Galatians
2:16`. The purpose of the Law is not to produce salvation or spirituality.

The salvation commandment is given in `1 John 3: 23`, ** “And this is his commandment, That we
should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another”.**

The fact that he says he has obeyed some of the commandments from his youth and the Lord does not
correct him shows that there is an age of accountability under which people are not responsible and
liable for rejecting the Lord. By application those who die while still being unaccountable, or due
to mental disadvantage do not reach accountability are automatically saved.  `2 Samuel 12:17-23`.

Different people have different capacities in the Christian life and will be subject to different
rewards. In eternity all born again individuals will have a resurrection body but the eternal
rewards will be different.

Third Prediction Of Death And Resurrection
------------------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:31-34
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:31-33
    :bold:

Each time Jesus told His followers what was going to happen to Him in Jerusalem He got more
explicit. In this passage He lays out specific events, and a sequence of events, which will take
place during this visit to Jerusalem. He is encouraging them to think in terms of scripture, and see
things from a divine perspective, understanding that when “bad things happen” there is a part for
them to play in the Plan of God, and they can relax into the plan, and just walk in the Holy
Spirit’s guidance.

He also ties this in with what the prophets have said will happen to the Messiah. He tells clearly
of the participation of the Gentiles in His trial and death. Three specific chapters of the Old
Testament make it clear that the Messiah will suffer and die, and very specifically identify the
indignity and evil he will endure.  `Psalm 22`, 69, `Isaiah 53`.

As Luke’s Gospel was to the Gentiles he wanted to make sure that the Gentiles were seen as major
players in the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. The whole world was guilty of the death of the
Saviour, and from Luke’s account there is no possibility of feeling any Anti-Semitism.   It is not
the Jews, the Romans, it is all people who share the responsibility, and it is all people who share
in the benefit of what He has done for all.    `Isaiah 50:6, 2 Peter 3:9, 1 John 2:2`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:34
    :bold:

As is common with the disciples they did not understand anything from what the Lord had told them.
They still expected the Kingdom to come into existence in the near future.  It is normal and very
human to expect the best, even when people are warning us about the worst.  The disciples wanted to
believe all would be well, and they didn't want to believe the words of Jesus.  No “theological
college” (Yeshiva) was teaching this viewpoint and so none of them had any frame of reference at all
for this concept of a suffering Messiah.   It would only be the lord’s personal teaching after his
resurrection that would shift their thinking, and with hind sight let them reinterpret the Word and
see it as it as meant to be.

Application
...........

Jesus Christ is seen as one who leads not only in triumph, but also in suffering. He knows the Plan
of God for His life and is going to fulfil it even if nobody else believes or understands it.

This prophecy shows that the Lord was following a deliberate plan and was not an unsuspecting victim
of a gross miscarriage of justice.

With the example of the attitude of our Lord Jesus Christ and His work on the Cross for us, how we
need to be devoted to Him day by day and serve Him to the best of our ability.

Healing Of Blind Bartimaeus Near Jericho
----------------------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:35-43
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:35-38
    :bold:

The blind, lame and others who could not work in the usual occupations of the day were left to beg
by the side of a road. Jewish people considered helping them a righteous act of giving alms, in the
same way as people in Moslem countries still do, as alms giving wins righteous points with God in
all legalistic faiths. The main road from Jericho to Jerusalem was perhaps one of the better sites
at which to beg, as many of the people who passed by were pilgrims heading for the festivals in
Jerusalem, and would be feeling more “spiritual” and more likely give.

This blind man hearing all the commotion around him asked those around what was going on. When he
was told that it was Jesus of Nazareth, the blind man shouted aloud, “Son of David”, a phrase that
meant that he recognised Jesus as the Messiah.  This blind man was a blind beggar sitting by the
side of a road, waiting for things to happen, but he had some biblical knowledge, which means he has
keenly listened to any Bible teacher, or reader of scripture he could, and he had memorized enough
to draw upon it at this time. He was physically blind and unable to do anything to improve his
condition, but he was not spiritually blind like the Pharisees. The Messiah comes along the road and
immediately the blind man recognises that the Messiah can do something about his blindness.  `Psalm
62:12, Isaiah 9:6-7, 11:1-2, Jeremiah 23:5-8`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 18:39-43
    :bold:

Blind people were socially powerless, and the crowd with Jesus see this shouting blind man as an
intrusion into the pilgrimage they are making with the Lord.  The powerlessness of the blind person
in society is demonstrated by the crowd who tried to make him keep quiet.  How often do well people
feel “intruded upon” by those who are needy and “spoil the moment” for those who have nothing to do
except enjoy a spiritual experience.  Notice the contrast here – for Luke wants us to reflect upon
this.  It is the blind man who will go on for Jesus, not most of the crowd.  It is not polite
attendance at meetings, and muffled applause at spiritual truth that the Lord desires of us, it is
passionate and noisy faith that gets active in changing the world!   The crowd’s indifference and
abuse increased rather than diminished this man’s calling out to the Lord Jesus Christ.

When Jesus said that his faith healed him, his words did not mean that the man’s faith had some
power, it was the power of God which had the ability to overcome the person’s problems.  This man
had simply expressed faith, and that was what was required of all these people – they needed to just
call out the truth, not just walk alongside the truth!  In the same way if Israel had faith in the
Messiah their faith would have healed their spiritual blindness.  They needed to be active in faith,
not passive – their spiritual passivity would lead them to their deaths at the hands of the Romans.

As often happened the response to the miracle was that then crowd as well as the blind man gave
glory to God.  The real challenge is what they were going to do after their time of pleasant
worship.

Application
...........

We never earn or deserve anything from God and never will. Whether we are carnal or spiritual, we
are always under grace. We are only here because of what our Lord is not for what we have done.

This is an illustration of the last being first, the blind men were on the bottom of the social
scale, yet by their faith in Christ they progressed far further than the sighted crowd who rejected
them.

The basis of the last being first is grace, the blind men are working on a grace basis while the
crowd is looking at things from a human viewpoint.

There is the evidence of faith here. Faith is the evidence of things not seen. They could not see
Jesus but they believed in Him. Faith appropriates grace. There is no merit in having faith. It is a
transitive verb with the merit in the thing or in this case the person believed in.

In the case of a person trusting in Christ for salvation, that faith focuses on the merits of
Christ. After salvation faith accepts promises and doctrines of God with the result that God is
glorified as these items are based on and reflect the Character of God.

The concept of cursing turned to blessing is seen in the fact that the blind men were from Jericho,
the place of cursing but in the place of cursing they found blessing.

Our criteria for the Christian life must always be what does the Bible say rather than what do
people say.

It is important to call out to the Lord as you have need, and opportunity because only He can solve
your problems and while He is always with you a lack of seeking Him may mean that a severe problem
you have will not be solved.

Spiritual outcasts unable to help themselves far more readily recognised the Messiah and asked for
His help than did the Jewish religious leaders.
