Instructs Disciples In Forgiveness And Faith

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:1-2
    :bold:

In this life sin cannot be eradicated and Jesus warns the disciples that offences will come into
being at times. Those who cause others to stumble are particularly in view with the Lord saying it
would be far better if that person was executed.  This severe word is to underline the negative
attitudes of the Pharisees, who would criticize people trying to live well, and yet would destroy
others by their advice.

Stumbling into sin can occur in a number of ways, where others are encouraged into worldliness,
slack behaviours, or sinfulness, or simply by watering down the teaching of Scripture, so that young
believers are not properly warned about evil. Anything that leads the believer away from a pathway
of simple faith, of devotion to the Lord, or from a spiritual life, is a stumbling block to their
success eternally.

The millstone used here is a heavier one, which was operated by a mule, rather than ones generally
operated by women. To be cast into the sea and drown was regarded as a terrible punishment, as it
was one which was used by pagans.  The Lord is seriously pointing out that to mislead children and
young believers generally is a great evil and one that God hates above other things.  `2 Peter
2:1-3, 1 Corinthians 8:9-13`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:3-4
    :bold:

Not only are Jesus’ followers not to cause others to sin, they also are to counteract sin by
forgiving others.   The spirit of forgiveness has already been illustrated by the father in the
Prodigal Son Parable, and the Lord goes further here.  As we approach the Lord and seek forgiveness,
so we need to treat others, as we want God to deal with us. `Psalm 103:6-18`.

The rebuking of a brother who has wronged you was seen as a private affair, and one of the major
thrusts in Jewish life was the freedom you had to decide what you did with those who offended you.
Jewish teachers did question the genuine nature of repentance if one was planning to sin again, but
Jesus here states that if there is genuine repentance there is always to be no question about what
might happen tomorrow. Jesus promotes the concept of unlimited forgiveness, taking all requests as
serious ones from fallen creatures, just like yourself.  `1 Corinthians 13:4-7, Ephesians 4:31-32,
Colossians 3:12-13`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:5-6
    :bold:

The thought of forgiving seven times in a single day presented a difficulty, if not an impossibility
to the apostles. They felt really inadequate to this task, so asked the Lord to increase their
faith. The reply from the Lord indicated that it was not so much the quantity of their faith, but
the quality of their faith using the faith they had.  The Lord sees their hesitation, for he has
asked them to deal with others in a way that opens you to abuse and being taken advantage of.  The
Lord understands that this is the situation, but in effect challenges the disciples to deep faith –
faith that reflects the love of God for them.

How would God see our requests for forgiveness, when we know we will sin again soon?  He still
forgives us, and yet we would deal with others in a different manner!  It was  step too far for the
disciples at this point, and way too far for the Pharisees.  Expressing faith, as also `Mark
11:22-23`, is another big challenge.  Do we have faith in God to seek and expect him to forgive?  Do
we have faith in others to forgive them?  Do we have faith to ask anything important of God?  What
do we believe that faith can actually achieve?  All this is before the Cross, and it will only be
the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit that will give the comfort and encouragement to achieve
these things.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:7-10
    :bold:

Most slave owners had few slaves, thus the slaves both worked in the fields as well as preparing
food for their masters. The masters naturally thought of these works as the slaves duties rather
than being optional.  The slave was “owned” by the master, and that meant they did not have their on
will to decide, but every waking moment belonged to the one owning them.  To us this is shocking,
but it is what people then understood, and the Lord uses it to illustrate true discipleship – for we
become the Lord’s slaves in that place.  He has paid the price for us and it was a terrible price,
that sets us free forever from sin and death.  `1 Corinthians 6:20, 7:23, 1 Peter 1:14-22`.

It was not considered appropriate behaviour for masters to eat with their slaves, and especially
inappropriate for the slaves to eat first. The slaves would prepare the meal and would always eat
after the master had eaten. They were the property of the owner and needed to recognise that what
the master required to be done was their duty to perform, without the feeling of having done
anything other than their duty and appropriate response to their master.  Paul catches this mental
attitude, as does Peter.  `1 Corinthians 9:16-27, 15`>9-11, `Philippians 3:7-12, 1 Peter 5:5-7`.

Application
...........

We are to be careful not to give offence, nor to take it, but to serve with focus upon our Lord and
Saviour who gave his all for us. We have to model ourselves on the principle of unlimited
forgiveness, just as we were unlimitedly forgiven.

The question that the apostles asked about increasing their faith is the reminder to us to keep our
faith straightforward and strong, trusting in the Holy Spirit’s power and daily being involved in
the worship/work of the Lord. While we are working for the Lord we will see the Lord working
in/through us, which will naturally increase our faith.

It is our own pride and self importance that prevents us from forgiving our brothers. That pride
needs to be rooted up and cast out. If faith can give us great things, then proper exercising of
faith can help us look at things in grace and overcome any unforgiving attitude.

The true bond slave of Christ has no reason for pride. Self importance must be removed and replaced
by a true sense of unworthiness, but then added to that is gratefulness at the great price paid to
secure our “ownership” from the slave market of sin and death. The slave belongs to the master and
his primary duty is to obey. We need to be whole hearted for the Lord, just as he was whole hearted
for our eternal salvation.

The Ten Lepers
--------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:11-19
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:11-13
    :bold:

Leprosy was a skin disease for which the Jews had prescribed quarantine rules as given in `Leviticus
13:45-46`, **“And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and  his head bare,
and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry,  Unclean, unclean. 46  All the days
wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without
the camp shall his habitation be”.**

Lepers were thus outcasts from the rest of society.  They stand respectfully and obedient to the
Mosaic Law at a safe distance, but they cry out to the one who may be able to change their position.
They naturally seek the restoration of their position as full members of society, to gain their
families and friends back again.  It would appear that the lepers at this stage were unbelievers, as
they called out Jesus, the Lord’s human name rather than Lord which would recognise His deity.  They
do recognize his status as a great teacher, and they cry in hope.  They have heard a little of the
wonder working power of Jesus, and that he has healed leprosy, for they would not have called these
words to any Pharisaic Rabbi, but Jesus is reported to have power to heal.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:14
    :bold:

A study from the Greek shows that the Lord having perceived, or recognised them [participle of
Eido], said to them [Indicative mood of Epo], that having gone to the priests they must exhibit
themselves [Imperative mood of Epideiknumi], to the priest.  They are given a faith test – to go to
the priests as if they are healed – before the healing has become active within them.  `Isaiah
65:24, John 4:48-54, 9:1-7`.

It came to pass as they were departing with that intention [Infinitive mood of Hupago], they
received cleansing [Passive voice of Katharizo].  This showed that it was not until they moved to go
to the priests that they were cured of leprosy.  It is to be remembered that healing people from
leprosy was one of three categories of miracles that according the Pharisees only the Messiah could
perform. The other two was giving sight to the blind and exorcising a demon from the dumb.

Previously one leper had been sent to the priests to be examined thoroughly under the guidelines in
`Leviticus 14` and declared clean. This was a sign to the priests that Messiah was present. In this
case however ten lepers now were told to go to the priests with the fact of the healing undoubtedly
going to the highest level in the priesthood, Caiaphas the High Priest.  The Lord is providing the
overwhelming evidence of his healing power, for one case may “spontaneously remit” but not ten, and
ten is the quorum for a new synagogue, and so it becomes evidential for messianic purposes, for
there are now at least twelve lepers healed to this point in Jesus ministry and all will have their
names and addresses recorded in the temple after they have offered up their sacrifices. `Leviticus
14`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:15-19
    :bold:

The fact that one of the lepers, the one who came back to glorify God was a Samaritan, is again of
interest as it would appear that in leprosy the Samaritans and Jews were outcasts together, and
their mutual disgrace and shame erased other social/racial distinctions.  This is an example to the
disciples of the level of thankfulness in the people who have been miraculously changed with only
one in ten returning. In addition the person who returned was a despised foreigner, a Samaritan.

The lack of gratitude by the other nine was typical of the rejection by the nation Israel of their
Messiah. They would accept being fed and healed by Him, but would not accept Him as the Messiah of
Israel. His ministry however was better received by their despised neighbours, the Samaritans as
seen here and in the response at the town of Sychar in `John 4`.  In the context that Luke has given
us reflect on the point being made.  The Pharisees expect salvation as of right, but their lack of
gratitude to God and forgiveness towards their fellow man, makes them unworthy of the grace that is
rejected by them.

The people of Israel have received grace, and yet most also expect it, and feel entitled to it, and
do not feel the obligation to respond as the slaves to grace they ought to become.  The
Gentiles/Samaritans are responding appropriately, and so these despised groups enter the kingdom
ahead of the people to whom the message was first to be preached – the Jewish people.

The final phrase in this passage “**Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole” **would
indicate that the Samaritan leper had not only been cleansed from the physical disease of leprosy
but had also been saved from sin. In his leprosy he was exposed to Judaism and has responded to the
gospel message, and in Jesus, through his healing, he has met his Messiah.

The word for “made whole” in the Greek is Sozo, which means to be saved or made secure. It is in the
perfect tense here, showing that it is an act that has occurred in the past, with results that go on
permanently into the future.

Application
...........

All the miracles performed by our Lord had a specific purpose. The healing ministry to the lepers
was a sign to the religious leaders as to who the Lord Jesus Christ was. By application all parts of
the plan of God are for a common goal, which is the glory of God, and that glory is most fully seen
at this point through the grace gift of salvation that comes to all people who bow their knee to the
Lord Jesus Christ through faith.

The lepers though far from the Lord, used their free will to call out to the Lord to have mercy on
them. The Lord responded by healing them of their disease.

It was of great comfort for all the lepers to be healed, but enjoying the power and blessings of God
without thankfulness to God means that we do not receive the maximum effect of the blessing. The
tenth man receives all that God has to give him, both physically and spiritually.

Healing from physical problems especially if it isolates one from loved ones is important but it
pales into insignificance to receiving salvation through faith in Christ.

The perfect tense of Sozo in verse 19 again indicates the Eternal Security of the believer; that
once you are saved you always are saved.  We are secure, because we are built upon the Rock, and
that Rock is not our work but Christ’s work for us.  `Ephesians 2:4-16`.

The Lord Jesus Christ is the source of all solutions to the problems of man, with Him being the only
way to eternal life, `John 14:6`, and the power to live this life for His glory.

The Coming Of The Kingdom
-------------------------


.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:20-37
    :bold:
    :title:

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:20-21
    :bold:

The Pharisees as always are looking for the physical setting up of the Kingdom of God on the earth.
However because of the rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ the Kingdom had been “postponed” as far as
they were concerned, because of unbelief in the King. What will be set up however will be what is
called “the Mystery Kingdom” and that kingdom is not visible; it is not in one place but is amongst
them in the person of the Holy Spirit filled members of the kingdom.  They are looking outside of
themselves for the kingdom, and searching for signs in the political world, but the real signs of
the kingdom are within the people who are totally devoted to the King.  `Matthew 7:13-23,10:33,
12:28, 13:23, John 15:2-17, James 3:17-18, 5:1-6, Romans 14:17-18`, .

This does not mean that the Kingdom of God was in the Pharisees, but does point to Christ who is the
King being in their midst, but they cannot recognize the reality, because they are so convinced of
what God is supposed to do, that they cannot see what he is actually doing.  Luke uses a medical
term in verse 20, translating a word Jesus used in a way that communicates the truth clearly – no
matter how closely we look for signs of a coming event, we will not see it if we are looking for the
wrong thing.   In medicine this is the greatest error a doctor can make – to be so clear in his/her
mind about the situation that they are only searching for certain symptoms and so they miss the
later seen to be obvious ones, that something totally different is occurring!

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:22-25
    :bold:

The disciples, as they face later persecution, after the Lord has returned to heaven, will desire to
see the Second Advent, but they will not live long enough to see it. We of course ourselves are
still awaiting the Second Coming of Christ.   It is normal for believers in the Church Age, who know
the scriptures, to long for the Coming of the Lord.  This expectation is to be expressed at the end
of every Communion Service.  `1 Corinthians 11:26`.

Unlike the first coming when Jesus was seen only by a few, when He returns a second time all men
will see Him. However before the return of the Lord other things must occur. One thing that must
precede his Second Coming is that He must suffer and be rejected at the first advent; the Cross must
come, as we have seen so many times, and it must come fully, before the Crown is received at the
Second Advent.  When he returns there will be no doubt about it.  It will be as lightning from one
corner of the world to the others.  `Zechariah 9:11-17, Daniel 2:44-45, 7:9-14, 21-27, 9:24-27,
12:1`ff.

The Tribulation Period will also occur, during which Israel as a nation does accept their Messiah,
and asks him to return – for he will only return when his people Israel ask him to return as their
Saviour and King.  `Zechariah 12:10`ff.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:26-30
    :bold:

Another thing that precedes the Second coming will be the Tribulation Period, a time of great
testing during which Israel as a people do business with their God and recognize the terrible errors
made during his First Advent. When the Tribulation hits there will be normal conditions on the
earth, not unlike those just prior to the coming of the great flood of the days of Noah. Immediately
before disaster struck the majority of mankind will be leading normal lives; eating, drinking and
getting married.   Denial of spiritual reality has always been Satan’s main tool to enslave mankind
and it remains so to the end.  It is absolute obedience to the Plan of God for our life that keeps
us safe, and obedience alone that does so.

This passage also shows the preservation of the believer who obeys God’s instruction even though
they are in a very dangerous and ultimately fatal situation for most. The parallelism here is that
the Lord Jesus Christ will return and save the remnant of the Jews and other believers from complete
destruction.  As the Lord delivered Lot, so the Lord will deliver his people in these darkest of
days, even though they will feel that the world is ending, just as Lot did.  Those who linger and
long for a world that is passing, rather than obey, will die as Lot’s wife died.  `Genesis 19`,
`Hebrews 13:10-15`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:31-33
    :bold:

The Lord clearly states here that the security of material things will not save the person at these
last days. In fact by turning back to recover “stuff”, having escaped the worst of a threat, their
delay and distraction may end in their death. The Lord is there to rely on, but his words must be
obeyed. Being self reliant when faced with an order from God can be foolhardy whilst submitting to
his guidance is the place of security. It should be noted that the Greek word translated preserve is
Zoogoneo, which means “to be rescued from death”.  Believers need to focus only on spending their
daily live sin the Lord’s service, not preserving their lives for later – there is no “later” except
for those in the will of the Lord.

This is reminiscent of the action of people at the time of the erection of the abomination of
desolation at the mid point of the Tribulation where those believers in Jerusalem who see this
happening are instructed to flee to the mountains of Edom, Moab and Ammon. If they do not flee they
are killed.  `Daniel 11:40-45, 12:1`ff, `Zechariah 12:10` – 14:7.  The Lord’s key point is seen as
man’s security today that all is going to be swept away in those last days in the Tribulation
Period.  Believers need to fine tune their desires and be absolutely focused upon what is important
spiritually, and not be distracted by economic, political, or social issues – seeking only the will
of the Lord for their life.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:34-36
    :bold:

This passage is often taught as a picture of the Rapture of the Church, with the one taken being the
believer, but looking at this in context, and at the other parallel passages, it is clear that this
deals with the period at the Second Advent, with the one taken away being the removal of the
unbeliever, while the one left is the believer, who will enter into the Millennium in his physical
body and help repopulate the earth.

It is noted that verse 36 does not occur in many manuscripts, but its inclusion, which tends to
harmonise this account with `Matthew 24:40`, either adds nor subtracts any additional light on the
subject. It is also of note that men and women in these verses do not appear in the original, so
there are just two in bed and two grinding at the mill. Again what gender are involved is
inconsequential.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 17:37
    :bold:

This rather unusual comment relates to the thinking of those within the nation Israel at the time.
`Daniel 11:41-45` and `Isaiah 59`, 61, 63, and 64, had all made it clear for over 500 years before
this time, that there were a number of places that would be refuges during these last days, while
believers awaiting the rule of Messiah.  Many of those who flee are in the land of Edom, and beyond,
where they have fled, with the eagles being Gentile armies invading the area. They use propaganda to
try and encourage these people to come out of the caves as they say the Messiah has returned is seen
in verse 23 above. Refer to the parallel passages in the Harmony, especially `Matthew 24`, where the
details are explained more fully.

Application
...........

The parallelism between the Flood and the Second Advent is seen that they were worldwide judgments.
There is one other total judgment, at the end of the Millennium. From this we have the biblical
concept of Civilisations, where man starts in harmony with God, and the period ends in universal
judgment upon the civilization that man has built.

In the pre flood civilisation man started in Innocence and ended in the judgment of the Flood. In
the post flood civilisation we start with believers only, eight of them, and we end with the
universal judgment at the Second Advent of Christ. The third starts with believers only, after the
Sheep and Goat judgement, and ends with the permanent removal of unbelievers at the end of the
Millennium.

Politicians and others always have the concept of man starting off debased and getting better with
time while the Bible clearly shows that man starts off well but becomes generally more depraved in
time.

At a time of great peril, love of material things may cause you to become a casualty. At such times
it is necessary to see the temporary nature of all things in this life. We need to get our
priorities right, and the Lord’s will is all that matters.

Lots wife was almost dragged out of Sodom, but her attention remained on that city. Someone has
rightly said that the angels and her husband could get Lot’s wife out of Sodom, but you could not
get Sodom out of Lot’s wife.

We need as individuals to be prepared for the future; for difficult times ahead. We do this by
understanding and applying the Word of God to our everyday lives.  Worship and spiritual work for
the Lord prepares us for the worst of times that are coming.
