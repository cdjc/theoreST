Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:1-2
    :bold:

Many religious Jews emphasised talking about the Law whenever possible, so no one could legitimately
complain about the Lord communicating God’s message during fellowship around a meal.  They would
talk about the Law, but they would not obey the Law, nor would they accept that the Lord gave it to
Moses, and so he had the sole right to make any changes in it.

A number of Pharisees and Scribes observed the meal, but did not eat with those excluded from the
religious community, as eating with such groups indicated acceptance of those who were sharing
fellowship around a meal. They however kept on looking on and complaining about the Lord and His
association with these despised lowest groups in society.

In the theology of the Pharisees they believed that God rejoiced over the death of sinners, and
ignored the lives of the lower classes, and if Jesus really was the Messiah he would not welcome
sinners.  These people considered God to be as arrogant as they were.

The Mishnah had many rules covering the relationship between the Pharisees and the publicans and
sinners. The Pharisee was not allowed to buy or sell anything to the publicans/tax collectors and to
all they considered as “sinners”. The Pharisee was not to eat at his table and thus partake of
something that may not have been tithed.

The Pharisee was not to admit anyone to his table until he had put on the clothes of a Pharisee. He
was not to do anything in his presence in relation to the law of purification, because he didn't
want the sinner converted, as he didn't want “that sort of person” to become part of their group!
This level of arrogance had perverted the Mosaic Law to a disgraceful state.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:3-7
    :bold:

This parable and the one following deal with God’s concern for all his people, and His holy desire
that all may enjoy a permanent relationship with Him. The Pharisees were not having a good day, as
in this first example a shepherd is used and they considered shepherds members of an unclean
profession.  These men are being rebuked totally by the Lord in all he says and does.  The Lord will
rebuke them, and their hatred of the Lord will increase as a result.

A flock of one hundred was probably an average sized flock. The shepherds used to travel together so
it is likely that the shepherd seeking the wandering sheep would leave the balance of his flock with
a companion shepherd. The shepherd returns with the wandering sheep across his shoulders with its
legs across the shepherd’s chest. There is rejoicing on his return by all, for each sheep was a
considerable investment.  Their main value was in milk and cheese production, and they were only
killed when old and unable to be used for milk, or for some special occasion.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:8-10
    :bold:

The woman in this parable would not have been rich, the ten silver coins maybe the woman’s ketubah
or dowry, the only money the woman brings into a marriage. In the ancient world the floors were
rough and lighting within normal houses poor due to small or no windows at all.

She seeks earnestly the coin, having lit a candle and sweeping, hoping that she might hear the coin
move, and therefore retrieve it. The dropped coins were often not found as seen by the number of
coins which have been discovered at archaeological sites. Again when the coin is found there is
rejoicing, for she has recovered her life savings and her hope of a future.

Application
...........

The point of both parables is that the individual is important. Some view this as a salvation
passage while others see it as restoration of the sinful believer.

I take the latter view, as whilst the sheep went astray, it was a sheep when it went astray, and
came back a sheep to join those who had not gone astray.

This can also be tied into the parable of the prodigal son [ see next section] who came back into
fellowship after a significant period away.

We know that angels observe man and the return of one person who changed his mind is greeted with
joy when he is able to produce or be effective in the Plan of God.

Each time a person returns into fellowship this adds to the good of eternal value, which is being
produced by those who are in fellowship.

God is very keen to ensure that we have a productive Christian life and does seek us out when we
wander away through the ministry of then Holy Spirit.

The Prodigal Son

Background And Analysis
.......................

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:11-13
    :bold:

To ask from your father early access to your inheritance was unheard of in the ancient world where
the father figure was revered and respected. It was almost the same as saying to your father that
you wished he was dead.  This would be considered a serious act of rebellion which under certain
circumstances could have serious consequences under the concept of `Deuteronomy 21:18-21` which
says,  **“If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father,
or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 19
Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city,
and unto the gate of his place; 20  And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is
stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. 21  And all
the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he  die: so shalt thou put evil away from
among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.”**

Jewish law did permit a father to determine which assets would go to the sons before he died, but
they could take possession only on the father’s death, especially in the case of land, where the
father remained manager and beneficiary of the profits until then. The son could therefore know what
he was to inherit but could not sell it as the younger son did.

It was also true that the elder son received the double portion so the younger brother would have
received a third of the inheritance.  This is a situation driven by self centeredness on the art of
the son, and his subsequent behaviour proved he was disreputable and to be condemned in the eyes of
the Pharisees.  That is Jesus point with this parable; he has picked the sort of fellow who the
Pharisees would not want redeemed, but would prefer he stay in the far country in the pig pen, in
fact their viewpoint demanded it.  `Psalm 10:2-6, Proverbs 27:8`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:14-16
    :bold:

In the ancient world, where the economy was based on rural production, famines were a common
devastating feature to a country. Here the younger brother who has squandered his inheritance
becomes a servant to a citizen in the foreign land and is sent out to feed the pigs. For the Jews to
have anything with pigs was frowned on and would be seen as divine judgment for his earlier sins.
He would be seen by the Pharisees to be beyond redemption.

What the husks were that the prodigal son desired to eat is open to debate. Some say that the pods
are a kind of carob pod that Israel would only eat during famine, others prickly pods of wild plants
which the pigs could reach for food. Either way the food was not appetising and the thought of
sharing a meal with pigs would have disgusted the hearers. `Psalm 116:3-9, Isaiah 1:10-18, Hosea
2:6-7, 4:6, 6:1-2`.

The Jewish hearers would now expect the story to continue that this wastrel had received what he
deserved and finish with a moral commandment to be true to law or else you will reap the same
consequences. The story however develops in a quite different way.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:17-19
    :bold:

In verse 16 the young man is jealous of the pig’s food ,which would indicate that he was not
receiving fair wages from the citizen of the far country, by whom he was employed. The hired men
that his father has could either be slaves rented for hire or wage earning workmen classified as
servants. The fact that his father had either indicates that the father was well off.

The statement “sin against heaven” means that the prodigal son recognises he has sinned against God
as well as against his father. The son returns to his father because of his hunger, and the belief
that his father might employ him as a wage earner, and thus give him access to food. He has come to
the place of total humility – there is true fruit of repentance in this boy’s life.  `Psalm
73:21-28, Matthew 7:13-23`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:20-24
    :bold:

It was against the dignity for an elderly Jewish man to run at all, so the love of the father is
seen here, where the normal protocols are set aside. In order to run the man would have to hitch up
his robe.  It was a sign of the deepest love and desire focused upon his lost son.  He was prepared
to suffer public indignity to restore his son to the family, where most would prefer the son to
carry all the indignity himself.  God is not like the Pharisees.  `Deuteronomy 30:1-6, Psalm 86:5,
15, Isaiah 55:6-12, Ezekiel 16:6-14`.

Kissing by males is common practice as a form of greeting in many parts of the world. The author has
had experience on mission trips in Ukraine of men coming and kissing me at the end of a service.
Paul commanded others to greet brethren with a holy kiss.  This was a normal social protocol and
reminds us that whatever is culturally appropriate is to be our practise – as we are always to give
the right message about our desires and values to those we work amongst.

The robe was probably one of the father’s robes, the ring a signet ring, which would have given
access to the bank account, and sandals which slaves did not wear. What the father is saying is that
the son is being returned as a son and not as a person on wages.  This man has returned, dirty,
unshod, and without any funds, clean clothes, or food to his name.  He is in grace being restored,
when he expected to be made a servant, and would have rejoiced in that role.

The fatted calf was reserved for certain very important occasions such as a marriage or the coming
of age of a son. It would appear the fatted calf was not sent out to graze as the Greek word fatted
can also be translated grain fed. The father is so delighted that his errant son has returned that
he causes the calf to be killed and a great celebration to start in commemoration of the return of
the prodigal son.

The only important person not included in these celebrations to date is his older brother, who
responds in a far less positive way than the father.  The father has even interrupted the errant
son’s confession of sin, and made it clear that even before he spoke, he was forgiven.  All he had
to do was return and repent, and he is already restored in the father’s heart.  So does God restore
us.  `Psalm 51:4, 103:6-19, 143:2-6, 144:1-4`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:25-28
    :bold:

The response of the elder brother can be considered using the Greek verbs in this passage. He had
been continuously in the fields [Imperfect tense of Eimi], and having come from there [Participle of
Erchomai], at a point in time, came close [Aorist tense of Eggizo] to the house, and at that point
heard [Aorist tense of Akouo] the music and dancing.

Having called or summonsed a servant [Participle of Proskaleomai], he continued to demand of him
[Imperfect tense of Punthanomai], his wish to know the meaning [Optative mood of Eimi] of the
celebration.

The servant said at that point [Aorist tense of Epo], that his younger brother had arrived [Present
Tense of Heko].  As a result the fatted calf had been killed at that point of time [Aorist tense of
Thuo], and he had been received at that point of time of arrival [Aorist tense Apolambano], having
been found in good health [Participle mood of Hugiano].

This news caused the older brother to receive anger [Passive voice of Orgizo], and from that time he
kept on desiring not [Imperfect tense of Thelo] to enter into the house [Aorist tense of
Eiserchomai].  His father came out of the house at that time [Aorist tense of Exerchomai], and
continued to invite the elder brother into the party [Imperfect tense of Parakaleo].

The constant refusal of the son to enter the house was also an insult to the father and could have
resulted in discipline from the father [see `Deuteronomy 21:18-21` above].   This man is justified
in being angry, as far as Pharisaic Law was concerned, for he had written off his younger brother as
a waster of the family substance and and immoral and dangerous person.  He was absolutely right and
correct in all this, for this is how his brother had been in the past, but all was changed with
repentance.  This is the point that Jesus is making here, and this is the point that the Pharisees
didn't want to accept – they didn't want repentance to apply to such people.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 15:29-32
    :bold:

The elder brother now addresses his father, but without the courtesy of a title Father or Sir, and
launches into a fit of jealous criticism of the father’s gracious attitude to the younger brother,
and the fact that he had never had a small animal given to him to have a party with his friends.
This is straight jealousy and bitterness on his part, and betrays his frustration at the hard work
he has had to put in to restore the family fortunes after the younger brother took off with the cash
assets.  He is right in his upset, for he has worked hard, but wrong in his attitude, for he looses
nothing by the younger brother’s return. All that he has worked for will be his, not his younger
brother’s.

Because the inheritance had been divided the elder brother was assured of his share, and had nothing
to lose by his brother’s return. He had benefited from constant blessings by association with his
father while the younger brother had wasted his time, money and had lived miserably.   He also had
access to the flocks and herds and could have used them for himself at any time, but chose to keep
breeding the stock back up to the levels before his brother left, so his decision making is in view
here, not just the father’s.  We do not know if the older brother repented or changed his mind and
joined the party, or whether he went off to a far country in his jealous rage.

It is also of interest that the occurrence of making merry in this passage are both in the passive
voice, meaning they may receive merriment whilst in verse 26 the mood is in the infinitive, meaning
that it was the fathers intention to make merry whilst the older brother using it in verse 30 uses
the subjunctive mood, which means perhaps they would be merry if a kid had been made available by
the father for him.  He is the legalist, and is challenged by grace and doesn't like it, and so the
Lord doesn't tell us what happens to him, for he is now outside the father’s joy and so has made
himself irrelevant by his mental attitude sins.  That is what mental attitude sins do to us – they
lock us out of the joy of the Father.  `Proverbs 6:16-23, Ephesians 2:1-10`.

Application
...........

We are all dependant on the mercy of God, we deserve and earn nothing in the Christian life. It is
provided by the grace of God.

This is a good example of the eternal security of the believer, with the Father representing God who
provides all good things and is loving towards all believers. The younger son went to live with the
pigs but he remained a person, he did not turn into a pig, which is a symbolic name for an
unbelieving Gentile by the Pharisaic Jews, but he returned as a man.

The younger brother is like the Christian who goes off the rails ending up in great poverty. He
however repents and returns to God, and he returns to a place of blessing and joy. He has however
wasted a huge amount of time in carnality for which he cannot receive blessings on earth or rewards
in heaven.

The older brother represents a Christian who walks with the Lord on a regular basis and enjoys the
blessings on earth and will enjoy rewards in heaven. The older brother however is jealous, bitter,
and legalistic and forgetting that he was saved and sustained by grace.  By hating the carnal
believer being accepted back into fellowship in a gracious and joyous manner, the legalistic
believer robs himself of fellowship and blessing.

We need to spend a maximum amount of time in fellowship with the Lord and keep our eyes on the Lord
rather than on others, ourselves, and our circumstances, all of which can cause us to become
disillusioned in the Christian life.

As far as sins are concerned, with the exception of murder, sins of the mind and sins of the tongue
are those which God most deplores. The worst sin is that of Satan, the sin of pride and arrogance
towards others.
