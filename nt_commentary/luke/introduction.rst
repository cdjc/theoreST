Introduction
============



Luke tells us why he writes the book. It is the longest book in the New Testament and was written with Acts as one historical book. The first half of the book is therefore the Gospel of Luke which deals with the Lord Jesus Christ the perfect man, and this is followed by Acts, which details the spread of the good news about the perfect man. It was divided into half because of the length of a papyrus roll. The papyrus roll had a limit so that it could be moved by the fingers and could therefore be read on the roll. The limit is the length of Luke.

Many writings
-------------

In `Luke 1:1-4`, Luke says that many people have written books on this subject. There were certainly more than three Gospels at the time Luke was writing. What we have is the Spirit's testimony to Matthew, Mark and Luke as being inspired. Luke is going to “set it out in order”. He also says that he has a perfect/complete understanding of the sequence of events, which means that he has really searched these things out in detail. 

His Gospel is written to a man named Theophilus, who may have been Paul’s lawyer in Rome, but his name means “lover of God”. The two books may have been written as a lawyer’s brief, so that Paul’s defence lawyer could know the facts about Christ fully nd sequentially, as lawyers require the facts.

This is a Gospel written to the Greek mind and is a work of a man of training and intellect, who grew up in the Greek culture of the Eatsern Mediterranean. This is the best Greek in the New Testament, compared to Mark, which is almost schoolboy Greek. Luke’s emphasis is on the parables of Christ with the prominent idea being grace.


Luke the historian
------------------

Luke is an historian and one of the best in the ancient world. Many have unsuccessfully attempted to fault Luke as an historian. It was trying to fault Luke that brought about the conversion of Sir William Ramsey. Luke has been called by some the greatest historian in the ancient world. Anything that Luke has recorded and has not been proved archaeologically yet, will be if there is proof surviving.  He is incredibly accurate and careful of facts.

For instance Luke called the leaders in certain towns “archoi”. Many historians said that that could not be right as none of the leaders in towns in that area were ever called by this name. However a frieze was excavated at the city in question and on it was stated that it had been erected by the “archoi” showing Luke to be absolutely accurate for that time period, but not a later one.

Luke could not have known things written in his gospel without him speaking to people who were there at the time. Many things had been changed through the years following the Jewish rebellion 66-70 AD, and much of the Roman world was changed by the end of the first century itself, even without wars.  

Much of Palestine had been changed by the devastation in the country due to the Roman advance in 68-70 AD. Great forests were cut down at this time. Two million Jews were either killed or sold into slavery. This was a holocaust with entire cities/disricts destroyed. Records that had been kept for a thousand years were lost. Luke’s Gospel and Acts could not have been written after 70 AD.

In `Luke 24` he gives no indication when recording the words of the Lord regarding the desolation of Jerusalem, which he surely would have, if he had been an eyewitness of the destruction, or was writing well after it. With the evidence you do not have to doubt the accuracy of the Gospel writer.

The Author
----------

We do not know where Luke was born, although most people in the century later, including Eusibius, claimed to have evidence which states it was in Antioch in Syria. Others say that it was Philippi in Macedonia. He studied medicine and is called the physician. He could have studied medicine in Alexandria, Athens or Tarsus. Some think that Luke and Paul met at the university of Tarsus. It is possible that Luke became a Christian under the ministry of Paul.

`Acts 11:25-26` indicates that he knew Antioch very well which gives some internal credence to that claim. He was a medical doctor - `Colossians 4:14`, and it appears that he practised medicine at Malta when he was on the journey to Rome with Paul. `Acts 28:1-10`.  We note that Paul cured the father of Publius in verse 9 and then it states that many people came and were healed. The second group of healings use a completely different Greek word. Paul miraculously healed, and Luke used medicine and prayer.

Luke is very much a man of prayer. He emphasises prayer, recording the prayers of the Lord Jesus Christ more than Matthew and Mark. He also includes three parables on prayer which do not occur elsewhere.

Women, children and the poor get more attention from Luke than the other Gospel writers. In his profession he dealt much with the needy of mankind and therefore it is appropriate that he dealt with the Lord as the Son of man. Luke emphasised the wonderful grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

In the area of his character he emphasises like Paul faith, repentance, mercy, and forgiveness.  He is stressing the human compassion of need, the compassion of the Lord for the children.  The weaknesses of men are highlighted here.

There is no controversy about the fact that Luke wrote both his Gospel and the book of Acts. There is so much internal evidence to this effect that even the liberals, who attack everything else, don’t bother to attack Luke. As far as a date or place is concerned we know that Acts ends about 62 AD with Paul and himself in Rome awaiting trial.   Paul is still awaiting his first trial. It is thought that Luke wrote the Gospel while Paul was in prison in Caesarea. He had access to people in Palestine at this time. Paul was in prison in Caesarea under Felix and Festus.

While Paul was in prison Luke was walking around talking to people. He goes out to interview people. He talks to Mary and the daughters of Philip the Evangelist. He travelled all over Palestine gathering information which otherwise would have been lost.

The Sources of Material
-----------------------

In Luke's Gospel you have a lot that is in Mark but is not in Matthew. There is common material for all three and then unique material. The first two chapters are very Hebrew, as you would expect with the subject matter and source, then it becomes very Greek in focus. You get a really Jewish flavour from the most amazing woman every to live - a Jewish woman in the form of the Virgin Mary. There are therefore six or seven main oral and written sources of Luke's gospel. He tells us that there are many records in `Luke 1`.

In this Gospel there is a collection of the sayings of our Lord, the parables, and the miracles. At least 320 of the 650 verses in Mark occur in Luke, and it is likely that he had the Gospel of Mark open before him whilst he wrote. Nearly half of Mark's gospel is in Luke. There is also evidence between Luke and Matthew that they are using the same source, probably from what was called by the ancients “Q”. 

Sections of `Luke 1`-3 are memoirs of Mary and others. The Bethlehem narrative must have come from Mary who grew up with the stigma of being an adulteress with the illegitimate son, as some Jews say even today. The accusations about his birth, ministry and death had caused a lot of pressure on Mary. She said it was these things that kept her sane over this period, and how she knew that she was a part in the plan of God.

Another source is the Herodian source. Luke has special information from the court of Herod. It is clear from this that someone became a believer from the Herodian court. Luke sat down with that believer and talked about it. Passages that show this include `Luke 3:1,19; 8:3; 9:7-9; 13:31, 23:7, Acts 13:1`.

The sixth area comprises other minor but interesting areas of information that he had gleaned by asking people, that the others either did not know, or had forgotten about, for example, `Luke 6:20-8:3`. There are many instances like this one, that do not occur elsewhere. 

This included the widow of Nain, the Good Samaritan, Mary Martha and the Lord, the Galileans who are killed on the way to the feast, the man with dropsy, the lost coin, the Rich Man and Lazarus, the Pharisees and the publican. These are all areas which have been examined solely by Luke. His very caring nature is seen in this way. He also obtained information from the daughters of Philip.

Luke was an investigative journalist. He talks to the witnesses and sifts the information. The original reader was Theophilus who was a Greek believer of the early church. Who was Theophilus? He might have been the lawyer who was trying to obtain the release of Paul. The Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles could have been a legal brief. It would certainly give him a very good understanding of the Christian church.  As a legal brief it must also have been available to the Roman Court, and as such becomes a very important document in history.  His style is very rich in the Greek language using some 250 words that none of the others use. This is the Greek of the university lecture theatre whereas Mark is the Greek of the schoolyard.

Luke and Paul have a very close relationship as did Peter and Mark. The Lord used both pairs of men in different ways. If you really want to understand Luke you need to saturate yourself in Paul's letters. Both the letters of Paul and the Gospel of Luke have the same theme - the grace of God, they both talk about faith and repentance. The words faith and grace appears many times. Faith appears 240 times in the New Testament with only 53 times outside the writings of Paul and Luke.

All of Luke's quotes are from the Septuagint with the exception of `Luke 7:27`. There are 25 direct quotes, 45 direct references and 30 allusions to the Old Testament.  He is writing to the Greeks whose Bible was the Septuagint. There was a lot of interest in the Hebrews in the ancient world.  The Greek speaking peoples saw in Hebrew culture and religion a purity that their own lacked.  They were drawn to the Prophetic Word.

The special feature is that Luke is completely comprehensive, and looks at the complete picture. He is trying to see everything that appeals to all men about the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the Lord's universal appeal to all people. He is the redeemer of all, the Saviour of all, all should come to Him, the emphasis of redemption being offered to all. 

He zeroes in on the individual with whom he is interested. His statements like "a little girl", or " the only son", little words showing his compassion. Luke plucks at the heart strings, with the lost sheep, the lost coin, the immoral woman, Zaccheus, the helpless debtor, the cry of the widow.

Another feature like that is his emphasis upon the gospel being good news about forgiveness. Luke uses the phrase, “your sins are forgiven thee”, many times in this gospel. 

Here you find the prodigal son returns, the publican praying, the dying thief being repentant. In his Gospel he records 9 prayers that Jesus offered seven of which are recorded in Luke and nowhere else.

It is in this Gospel that you have the great songs which have been used by the Roman Catholic church down the centuries:- Ave Maria [1:28-31], the Magnificat [1:46-55], the Benedictus [1:68-79], Glory in the Highest [2:14].  These became great songs during the medieval times.

Joy and rejoice are favourite words; they occur 19 times in Luke whilst in Matthew and Mark there are only 22 between them. Luke looks at reaching into home life as well, he talks about patching old clothes, the joy of the prodigals return, the man of the house telling the late visitor to go. This also showed that everybody slept in the same bed in the ancient world. 

The Bible tells us it is not usual to put babies in separate rooms. (God designed mothers to feed their own babies not cows to feed them. Most cot deaths involve three factors, people smoking, the fact that the child is not in the same room as the parents, and the baby gets cold.  There are many things in the Church today which are not accepted because we have been affected by English culture.)   Luke gives us a good dose of biblical realism.

The Theme
---------

If Mark is the gospel for the young believer, as we have seen, Luke is the gospel for the maturing Christian.  It will bring you closer to the heart of the Lord for suffering humanity than any others. The theme of the gospel is the perfect son of man. In Luke you are able to get to know the master. In Hebrews we are told that we do not have a high priest who does not know our infirmities. `Hebrews 4:12-16`.  In Luke you have the Lord preaching bluntly about what will happen to a man who will not accept Him. As we read Luke we think of the question, “how shall we be forgiven if we ignore such a wonderful Saviour?”  `Hebrews 2:3`.

In `Luke 16:13 - 31` we have the statement that nobody can serve two masters, and also the story of the rich man and Lazarus. This confronts us with the essence of the gospel appeal. This is not gentle Jesus meek and mild, He is giving the facts straight. The Lord speaks of hell more often than anyone else in the Scriptures. The story of Lazarus also points out the lie in the prosperity gospel. `Luke 16:19-31`. Obviously as a beggar Lazarus did not have a prosperous life. Here we have a believer who is dying of hunger covered in sores, but he is at peace with God in the midst of his poverty. 

It is not true as a believer that you will get physical blessings in time however we have blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Paul said that he knew how to abound and how to be abased. In all situations he has learnt to be content `Philippians 4:12, 13`.

Luke and the Issues of Life
---------------------------

Luke brings out the issues of life, in a way that show that things are perhaps not as simple as they first seem. Turn to and read `Luke 13: 1 - 5`. The Lord does not jump to trite answers about tragedies, and Luke brings this out, as a man of science himself. 

He points out the finality of hell, the reality of hell and the results of man's disobedience. He shows that even if someone comes back from the dead there are many who will not believe him. Jesus Christ will come back from the dead and they will not believe Him. If you are going to be dealing with the heresies of today the gospel of Luke is the one that you are best to use. Luke will correct your erroneous views. For example, Paul is sometimes classified as a hater of women, this is not so.

Women in the Bible
------------------

Luke, the close associate of Paul gives more space to women, and to their ministry, than any of the others with the possible exception of Paul. If you look at the end of Paul's letters you will find that half of those referred to for blessing and prayer are female names. Luke recognises the importance of the women's supporting ministry of the Lord, and spent time with Mary especially. The other Gospel writers did not do that.

Dr Scroggie says that we have no women recorded in Scripture who opposed the Lord Jesus Christ in His ministry, but many men. It is the women who know more than the disciples at the Cross. In the ministry women will tend to be your greatest support. Women in the church are the greatest asset and tend to get with the truth of God's Word more than men. You need to mobilise them in prayer as the Lord and Paul give you example.

We see the portraits in Luke of women such as Mary the mother of the humanity of Christ, Mary Magdalene, Anna, Mary and Martha, the widow of Nain, the woman who was a sinner who came to the Lord. Many of the parables in Luke deal with women. 

The interrupting woman `Luke 11:27`, the woman sweeping the house looking for coins `Luke 15:8`, the persistent widow who is hammering on the door of the unjust judge, the women witnessing the crucifixion `Luke 24`. All the disciples have gone, but the faithful women are there. 

The women in the resurrection story who start off looking for the Lord. When they go back and tell the disciples that he has risen the men do not believe them.

Other Characters in the Bible
-----------------------------

Luke also talks about children. He tells how the children were brought to the Lord. We hear also of the widow’s only son, the epileptic boy as well as the compassion of the Lord. Here we have the beloved physician who loved the little folks.  

Luke is a real historian with Anna, Mary, Elizabeth, Simeon, Zachariah and Zacchaeus being given little character studies that show aspects of the Lord’s grace as it meets many different people with significant problems.

There are some interesting characters in Luke and his treatment of them if different compared to, say Mark. A case in point is the women who had had an issue of blood for twelve years. As such she was ceremonially unclean and was therefore not able to go to the Temple to worship. Mark says that she had been to the physicians and spent all that she had to no avail. In fact she had got worst. 

In contrast Luke defends his profession by saying that the doctors had been trying but it was a difficult case and did not find a solution. This gives an indication of the relation between Luke and Mark. He is reacting to what Mark has said and shows that Mark was written before Luke. It also gives a little insight into the gentle physician who was quick to defend his profession.

Luke uses a lot of medical terms. He is interested in details. Of the six miracles which are unique to Luke five are miracles of healing. He is also interested in angels with 23 references to angels. He emphasises that the Lord is involved in the angelic conflict. There is good and evil at work here with forces beyond man.      

Luke draws a contrast between John the Baptist and the Lord and balances the story of the two. We have the last of the Old Testament in John the Baptist, and in the Son of Man, we have the fulfilment of the Old Covenant. There is also an emphasis on the Christmas story.

The Kingdom Teaching
--------------------

He makes the point for us not to tie in with the people who are promoting “the kingdom” today, because the kingdom is within you - `John 18:36`. Jesus says that His kingdom is not of this world. If it was then my servants would fight. The gospel of the kingdom is the kingdom/gospel of salvation. 

The gospel today is the kingdom in you. This does not mean that he is not going to establish his kingdom at a later date. If you are purely looking at Matthew and Mark you are not going to spot that; once again the importance of all four gospels being open before you.

`Luke 17:11-19:48` which is the Lord's words on His walk to Jerusalem where he is talking about the kingdom of God.    In `Luke 18:18` he says that it is very hard for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God. Here He is talking about salvation. 

The question of how to inherit eternal life is exactly the same as asking how to enter the kingdom of God. The Lord makes it clear that one day he is going to be king on earth but that he wants to be king of our lives now.   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. `John 3` ties in with `Luke 18`.

Luke's view of the crucifixion is an excellent one together with the resurrection and the great commission. `Luke 24` compares with `Matthew 28`. Reading this in conjunction with `Mark 16` gives you perception in depth on what is happening.  As a navigational fix it helps to have two or three inspired accounts of an incident.

In his gospel we see Luke stressing the wonder of the Son of Man; the joy and wonder of knowing the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. How great is your appreciation and feeling of debt to Christ? Luke's gratitude and joy shows in that he is interested in every little detail; so ought we to be. Luke looks at the attitude of John the Baptist, and how he stated that all must point to Christ. He also tells the story of Mary and Martha, the woman who does little things.

What lessons about humility do you get from this? What is your relationship with people in poverty? There is a challenge in Luke's gospel in meeting the needs of the poor at the spiritual and physical level. We need to be practical in our application. Luke brings into highlight  our social conscience. He is interested in people. People are being introduced to the Son of man. Here is a challenge to personal evangelism and social action.
