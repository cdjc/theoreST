Background and Analysis
-----------------------

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:26
    :bold:
    

The words “was sent” is in the aorist passive indicative. The aorist tense is the point of time he was sent, passive voice is the fact that he was sent by God, Indicative mood is the voice of reality.  The next angelic visitation occurs in the sixth month of the pregnancy of Elizabeth.  This is the next step in what the great preacher Dr W G Scroggie called the “unfolding drama of redemption”.  God sends the angel to advise Mary of her choice as the one to bring the Messiah/Saviour into the world of men.  

We notice also that he was sent to Nazareth of Galilee. Nazareth has the meaning associated with the words for root shoot, branch. `Isaiah 11:1`. “And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots.”   The Lord will grow up in this town, and be nurtured here by two wonderful chosen people; Mary and Joseph.  The four parents of these two men are the greatest people of their generation, and we often underestimate their spiritual “giant” status, for their service was humble and hidden.  They served in their homes and they served well, and they brought up in godliness and holiness the herald and the King of kings.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:27
    :bold:

Here we see Gabriel again, one of the two named elect angels, being sent to Mary. In `Luke 1:19` we see him bringing good news to Zechariah. Here we see him telling Mary of the forthcoming birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. The word Parthenos in the Greek means a virgin, and whilst the Hebrew equivalent in `Isaiah 7:14`, can be rendered young woman as well as virgin this is not the case in the Greek. Mary was a virgin – and the virgin birth is crucial for redemptive history.  Jesus must be born without any agency of man, and must be born as Adam was made, without sin.  If there is any contamination by a man, he inherits man’s sin form Adam and cannot be the sin bearer.  `Genesis 3:17-24`.

The word for espoused is the perfect passive participle, which showed that Mary had received engagement to Joseph in the past. The perfect tense indicated a state to be perpetuated. Betrothal or engagement normally lasted one year and unfaithfulness on the part of the bride to be, as well as her lover, was punished by death.  `Deuteronomy 22:23-24`.  The family line is given, as descending directly from David.  This is the royal line of kings of Judah, but now living in very humble circumstances, and since the days of Zerubbabel, never claiming the kingship.  `Ezra 1-2`. 

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:28
    :bold:

In this verse the angel comes in to talk to Mary and said, “Hail, highly favoured” [ the words “thou that art” are not found in the original]. The word translated “highly favoured” is in the Perfect Passive Participle, which shows that she has been given grace or enriched with grace. A similar concept is given in `Ephesians 1:6`.

The older manuscripts do not have “blessed art thou among women” at this point, but have the phrase in verse 42.  She has heard the words that every Jewish woman of the line of David had prayed to hear for over 500 years, that she would bring the King to rule in David’s place into the world.  We often under-estimate the status of Mary today.  We rightly condemn the acceptance of the late 19th century visions of the French peasant girls at Fatima, who bring in the now papal doctrine of Mary as “Mother of God”, and raise her to “queen of heaven”, for these are old pagan notions that go back to Babylonian religion, and have no place in biblical Christianity.  `Jude 3`.

Having said that, we ignore this godly and holy woman to our peril, for she is the greatest mentor for woman ever to live upon the earth.  She is certified as the greatest and most blessed of all women of history and we need to acknowledge her as such.  We do not err in this and go too far however, but practice the apostolic faith.  John the last of the apostles will be given care for Mary by the Lord, and will care for her in his own household from that day forward.  Mary will serve in the church at Jerusalem and tradition records as  a women in her late eighties she made the long boat trip to Ephesus to work with John there until her death.  Her grave is at Ephesus and is honoured by Moslem and Christian alike.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:29
    :bold:

Here Mary sees Gabriel for the first time. She has heard him in verse 28 but on seeing him she was troubled. The word troubled is in the aorist passive indicative, she received a troubled mind at the point of seeing the angel.  This is real revelation and it is not soft and fluffy, it is serious and awesome!  Today we have fake prophets and others seeing “angels” and they crow about it, and say how lovely it was, but that is the clue that they haven’t seen any angel form the Lord.  Angelic visitation is serious and awesome!  Godly people are exhausted by such things.  `Daniel 8:27, 10:16-19`.

The phrase “cast her mind” indicates that her mind was in overdrive, being both puzzled and upset by what the angel telling her, and what the permanent effect of what he was saying would be on her life.  Mary is searching through her store of bible doctrine and her life experience to date, and she is overwhelmed by the revelation she receives.  She asks herself, “What does this mean to my life?”   She knows that her life will never be the same again.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:30
    :bold:

Gabriel tells Mary not to fear. `1 John 4:17-21`.  The verb is in the imperative mood. It is an order. It is in the present tense which means that she is ordered to constantly not fear and the middle voice reflects that she is going to benefit from not fearing. Mary needed encouragement, as it was not everyday that a young girl would have a conversation with an angel.  She is rightly in fear initially, as she knows the seriousness of an angelic visitation.  

The word “favour” is the word “grace” and is a common Old Testament concept. “Charis” is a very ancient and common word with a variety of applied meanings. They come from the concepts of sweetness, charm, joy, blessing and delight; it indicated that the Lord delighted in the character and behaviour of this person.   This is the Lord’s approval of one who has walked in spirituality and is a fragrant offering daily to the glory of the Lord.  `2 Corinthians 2:14-16, Philippians 4:18-19`.  

New Testament examples include, words of grace, `Luke 4:22`, Growing in grace, `Ephesians 4:29`, living with Grace, `Colossians 4:6`.   It is also a favourite word for Christianity with such phrases as the “Gospel of Grace”. `Acts 20:24`. Mary is said to find favour/grace with God. The word “with” is the Greek word “para” which could be translated “in the sight of God”, and indicates a holy and devoted life that has brought joy to the Lord.  This is a spiritual young woman, and she is young, possibly as young as fourteen years of age.  `Isaiah 41:9-14, 43:1-7, 44:2`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:31
    :bold:

The phrase “conceive in the womb” has the same idiom in `Isaiah 7:14` of Immanuel. We talk about the virgin birth but more properly we should call it the virgin conception.    It is a unique event in history – occurring just this once, in order for the Messiah/Saviour to be born as Adam was created, without any sin at all polluting him.

In this verse also we have instruction from Gabriel as to the naming of the child. In this case the son is to be called Jesus, which is the Greek form of Joshua, and means Saviour.  It is now clear to Mary that she is to bear the Messiah of Israel and the Saviour of mankind from Sin.  She is the chosen vessel for God’s purposes.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:32
    :bold:

In the phrase “the Son of the Most High”, there is no article in the Greek, but the use of the Most High in verse 35 clearly shows that it refers to God. Here Mary is told that the son who will be born is the Messiah, for He is both God and the son of David, and that God the Father will give to Him the throne of David which has been vacant since the curse upon the line of Coniah (Joseph’s line) almost 600 years before.  `2 Chronicles 36:9-21, Jeremiah 22:28-30`.

The virgin birth of Christ allowed Him to reign as a king forever, as he was legally the King of the Jews from his father Joseph, but was also in the line of David physically through his mother Mary, and so as a son of Nathan, rather than Solomon, he escaped the curse upon Solomon and Jeconiah. `1 Kings 11:1-13`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:33
    :bold:

Gabriel now tells Mary that he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. This relates back to Jacob’s prophecy regarding Judah in `Genesis 49:10`, and also to the promise to David in `2 Samuel 7:8-29`. The kingdom which will start at the Second Advent of Christ will last for a thousand years, and will be called the Millennial Kingdom, and will then continue endlessly into eternity future. `Revelation 20`-22.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:34
    :bold:

Mary understood now that she was going to be the means by which the Saviour was going to enter into the world, but could not understand the means by which this was to be accomplished.   She recognizes that there is something unique and very special about the conception and birth process she is about to go through and is baffled.  She seeks clarification, not evidence.  She stands with her ancestor Abraham and believes!  `Genesis 15:6, 18:14`.

She asked Gabriel how this could happen since she had not had sexual relations with her fiancée. It is noted that the word man can be translated not only man but husband, and to all intents and purposes as she was espoused to Joseph and he was “her husband”.  Mary is not ignorant of sexual relationship being required for normal birth, but recognizes that what she is being told here is anything but “normal”.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:35
    :bold:

The Holy Ghost is the Holy Spirit. The Greek word used here is “Pneuma” which means spirit and thus we are talking about the third person in the Trinity.

The phrase “shall overshadow thee” is a picture of a cloud coming over her, which was a common concept in ancient Greek for the spirit of God coming upon people and transforming them. We see this with the accusative in `Acts 5:15` where Peter’s shadow was cast over some of the sick in the vicinity of the Temple.

We also have the shining bright cloud of the Mount of Transfiguration in `Matthew 17:5, Mark 9:7` and `Luke 9:34`, and the appearance of the Shekinah Glory which represented God’s presence in Old Testament times.   `Exodus 40:38`.   It is also the phrase that we find in `Genesis 1:2` with the Holy Spirit as the agent of creation, moving with creative power upon the earth and oceans.  The miraculous conception or virgin birth of Jesus Christ is therefore plainly indicated in Luke who seeing he was a physician gives added interest to his account, for he speaks here as one that knows that this was not any ordinary birth.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:36
    :bold:

The word cousin is the Greek word suggenis, which is simply a relative rather than necessarily a first cousin as we know it.   It should be remembered that even though Mary was a relative of Elisabeth the latter had hidden herself away from public view [`Luke 1:24`], so the angel gave the surprising news that not only Mary, as a virgin, was to have a child but also Elisabeth who was old and barren was already pregnant.  The angel tells Mary who then can be encouraged by her relative, who is also part of the plan at this point.   They have been woven together in the plan of God by grace, through their faith, and so they will encourage one another.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:37
    :bold:

These two amazing parallel miraculous events showed clearly that with God nothing is impossible. If He wishes to do something miraculous to further His plan He is more than able to do it and can be depended upon to achieve his purposes through obedient people.  `Genesis 18:14, Numbers 11:23-25, Jeremiah 32:17, 27, Zechariah 8:6-13`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:38
    :bold:

While Mary was staggered by these great pronouncements, she, unlike Zechariah, accepted them as from God. She recognised that the great honour bestowed on her as the means of bringing the Saviour into the world demanded nothing less that her complete obedience.  

Here she uses the Greek word for a female slave of the lowest order “doule”, one who was bound to her master for the term of her life. In this she showed complete obedience.  She seeks the power of God to achieve the will of God, through the Plan of God.  She desires nothing other than God’s purposes being worked out through her.  `Matthew 26:39, John 17:4-5, 18:37`.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Each of us have different roles to play in the Plan of God. We are given different spiritual gifts in order to undertake our unique service for the Lord, and while of course it will not be as spectacular as others, our service for the Lord is important.

We see with God nothing is impossible. We need to remember this when we are faced with apparently insoluble problems.  It is the path that Mary mentors that is the path for us all – that is the path of acceptance of the divine plan and embracing the power that the Holy Spirit provides within to walk it properly.
