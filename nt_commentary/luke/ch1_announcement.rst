Background and Analysis
-----------------------

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:5

In the days of Herod the king relates to Herod the Great. For full coverage as to his lineage see section 15. He claimed to be a proselyte to the Jewish religion but used Judaism only as much as it would enhance his secular plans.  He was the archetypal religious criminal figure using people’s faith to his own political ends and worshipping power alone.

For the first time in the history of Israel the Sceptre had departed from Judah [see Genesis 49:10].  As a result it was now time for the Jews to look for another governor from Bethlehem who should rule and shepherd the nation Israel [see Micah 5:1-2].   From the prophetic word of Daniel in Daniel 9:24-27 it was clear that these very days were thiose when Messiah would be born.  There was a great deal of messianic expectation around this period, for the calculation was clear – this was the day that Daniel spoken of.  

Zacharias is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Zechariah.

When the families of the priestly descendants of the tribe of Levi increased in number to an extent that they could not function in the Tabernacle at the same time David and Solomon divided them into 24 courses or classes so that they might serve by turns, 1 Chronicles 24:1-19.

Zechariah was in the course of Abijah which was the eighth in the order which had been established.

We note later in this verse that not only Zechariah but also his wife Elizabeth came from the tribe of Levi. Their son, John the Baptist, was also most well qualified by birth to be a priest being the son of a father who was a priest and of a mother who was the daughter of a priest.  By both father and mother he was descended from the family of Amram of whom came Moses, Aaron and Miriam three of the most illustrious characters in Jewish History.

We thus have a totally qualified king in the Lord Jesus Christ, and priest in the form of John the Baptist.
