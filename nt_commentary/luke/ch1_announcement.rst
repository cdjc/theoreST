Background and Analysis
-----------------------

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:5
    :bold:

In the days of Herod the king relates to Herod the Great. For full coverage as to his lineage see section 15. He claimed to be a proselyte to the Jewish religion but used Judaism only as much as it would enhance his secular plans.  He was the archetypal religious criminal figure using people’s faith to his own political ends and worshipping power alone.

For the first time in the history of Israel the Sceptre had departed from Judah [see `Genesis 49:10`].  As a result it was now time for the Jews to look for another governor from Bethlehem who should rule and shepherd the nation Israel [see `Micah 5:1-2`].   From the prophetic word of Daniel in `Daniel 9:24-27` it was clear that these very days were thiose when Messiah would be born.  There was a great deal of messianic expectation around this period, for the calculation was clear – this was the day that Daniel spoken of.  

Zacharias is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Zechariah.

When the families of the priestly descendants of the tribe of Levi increased in number to an extent that they could not function in the Tabernacle at the same time David and Solomon divided them into 24 courses or classes so that they might serve by turns, `1 Chronicles 24:1-19`.

Zechariah was in the course of Abijah which was the eighth in the order which had been established.

We note later in this verse that not only Zechariah but also his wife Elizabeth came from the tribe of Levi. Their son, John the Baptist, was also most well qualified by birth to be a priest being the son of a father who was a priest and of a mother who was the daughter of a priest.  By both father and mother he was descended from the family of Amram of whom came Moses, Aaron and Miriam three of the most illustrious characters in Jewish History.

We thus have a totally qualified king in the Lord Jesus Christ, and priest in the form of John the Baptist.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:6
    :bold:

Both Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous before God.  What this means is that they were both upright and holy in their outward conduct. As believers they were practicing their faith daily in the presence of God, being aware that He was observing them and their motives.   `Genesis 6:9, 7:1, 17:1, Romans 8:9-25, Philippians 3:4-12`.

They were both found to be mature believers walking with God. Here both of them were so to speak walking in maturity together before the Lord. They were an unusual and wonderful example to others.

The two words “Commandments and Ordinances” may relate to the Decalogue and the Ceremonial and Judicial Laws given after the Decalogue as all the precepts in chapters 21 –23  of Exodus are called judgments or ordinances and this was the basis of the divine regulations to Israel prior to the giving of the Holy Spirit.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:7
    :bold:

Like a number of prominent people in the Bible before, the couple who were to have a child of critical importance in the plan of God, were at this point unable to have any children and had been trying for many years. We see such examples as Sarah the mother of Isaac, `Genesis 15:1-5, 17:1-8, 21:1-7`, and Hannah the mother of Samuel in the Bible. `1 Samuel 1:6-21`.  The couple are now well into their forties and so having a child at this stage of life is a remote chance; indeed is is by the miracle of the Lord alone.

In the case of the Lord Jesus Christ as well there was a miraculous birth, not because Mary was barren, but because she was a virgin at the time of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.  It is of interest that in the case of Isaac, John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus Christ, the birth of these three were announced in exactly the same way, with God foretelling the birth of Isaac in `Genesis 17:16`, the angel of the Lord announcing the birth of John the Baptist in `Luke 1:13`, and Gabriel telling of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:8
    :bold:

Here we see Zechariah undertaking his priestly function before God. “Before God” means that he is in the Temple, which in time past was the location where God had manifested himself in the form of the Shekinah Glory. Since the destruction of Solomon’s Temple the Shekinah Glory had not however been present. On this occasion however the Temple was visited by an angel, and it will later be visited by the Lord.  The glory of this house will be greater than that of Solomon’s Temple, for this one will be visited by the Lord of glory, of whom the temple spoke in all its structure and work.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:9
    :bold:

In the Talmud we see that it was the custom of the priests to divide the various areas of temple service amongst themselves by lot. This meant he received the white stone that signified he had the particular job that day and in God’s timing it was the very day for him to meet the angel.  As a result the function allocated to Zechariah was to burn incense at the golden altar near the veil in the holy place, the outer and larger covered area in front of the veil that covered the Holy of Holies.

It was only once in a lifetime that a priest obtained the lot for going into the sanctuary and burning incense on the golden altar. The lot which gave approval was a white stone.  `Revelation 2:17`.  The role he had drawn for this day spoke of the prayers of the priesthood going up to God from the golden altar in the form of the smoke of the incense.  Zechariah would use this opportunity to offer up his own prayer for a child, and was going to experience the greatest event in this temple since it had been built.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:10
    :bold:

Here we see a large group of people outside the Temple praying at the time of the burning of the incense. The incense burnt on the golden altar represents prayer and praise to the Lord.  The entry of the priest into the Holy Place was a signal that prayer was to be formally offered from the golden altar and everyone who had a specific prayer to ask of the Lord would attend the temple at that time and pray their prayer at the time of the offering, so that as the smoke rose from within the building they knew their prayer had gone up to heaven also.  `Hebrews 4:9-16`.

Incense was burnt twice a day in the Temple, in the morning and in the evening.  `Exodus 30:7,8`. In this passage Luke does not stipulate which period was involved in this incident.  There is a holy spirit of prayer in the temple as Zechariah enters the Holy Place.  There is power in corporate prayer, and as we enter into the place of prayer we enter the place of blessing and direction, and this man will receive both.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:11-12
    :bold:

The word appeared in this verse is in the form that Paul used for the resurrection appearances of Christ in `1 Corinthians 15:5-8`. The appearance of the angel is clearly real as is shown by the indicative mood.  `Judges 13:3-23`.  These is fear in seeing an angel, for the Hebrew people realised that to do so was often to die, as the angels are both messengers and judges of men.  `Exodus 12:29-33, Numbers 22:22-35, Joshua 5:13-15`.  Eternity does not touch time without serious reason and important communication to be received.  

Zechariah’s duties for the two week period was to take the coals off the brazen altar representing the Cross and to bring it into the Holy Place to the altar of incense to burn the incense upon the coals. The altar of incense also known as the golden altar was made of gold overlaying wood representing the unique God man, the Lord Jesus Christ. 

The means of doing this are set out in the book of Numbers. Priests who violated the principles, and offered what is called strange fire to burn the incense were killed by God. `Numbers 16`. If God accepted the offering the priest came out alive, if not he wouldn’t. 

If the offering was not accepted by God current Jewish tradition recorded that an angel would appear on the right side of the altar. This is why Zechariah was filled with fear because he thought his death was imminent. Zechariah became aware of the angel’s presence and he became deeply troubled.  `Judges 6:22-23, 13:21-23`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:13-17
    :bold:

Verses 13 – 17.  This section takes on a metrical form when turned into Hebrew and is a prose poem in both the Greek and English, and is like `Luke 1:30-33, 35-37, 42-45, 46-55, 68-70, 2:10-12, 14, 29-32, 34-35`.  It is as if Luke was careful to write in such a way that these sections could be chanted or sung – which would be in accordance with his training as a Greek Doctor, as they had to learn oratory and poetry also.

In verse 13 Zechariah however is told not to fear, and he hears the good news for his, that Elisabeth is going to have a son. He is instructed by the angel to call the son John which means “God is gracious”.  This is not a family name, and so the instruction is clear and definite – he is to break with tradition here, because something is to be done with and through his son that is unique and amazing.

In verse 14, the words “shall rejoice” have the concept of, “shall have cause to rejoice” – it would prove to be a joyful event.  Fear will turn to joy in the Lord.  `Jeremiah 31:13, John 16:20, 2 Corinthians 6:10, 1 Thessalonians 2:19`.

Verse 15 – Great in the sight of the Lord. He was closer in standing to the Lord than any other of the prophets as seen in `Matthew 11:11a`, “Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist”

John the Baptist was a Nazarite from his birth, a feature he shared with both Samson and Samuel. Samson failed spectacularly while Samuel and John the Baptist kept the requirements of their status. The Nazarite represented purity and dedication whereas the leper represented sin. As the herald of the perfect king it was entirely appropriate that the herald should demonstrate the purity of the King. `Numbers 6:1-27`.

Verse 16 – We know from the context of John the Baptist’s ministry that he had a ministry much like Elijah with turning the people’s heart to the Lord. This is taken from Elijah’s prayer to the Lord when imploring the burning of the sacrifice at the conflict with the prophets of Baal. [`1 Kings 18:36-38`]. While both had major ministries the nation did not turn to the Lord at either time.

Verse 17 commences with the phrase, “and he shall go before him”. Who is “him”?  By reading back to the previous verse we see that it refers to the Lord their God. This shows that the Lord Jesus Christ is “Jehovah in the flesh”, or Emmanuel – literally - “God with us”.  `Isaiah 7:14, 8:8, 9:6-9, 12:1-2`.   

“In the spirit and power of Elijah”.  `Isaiah 40:1-11, Malachi 3:1-5`. This indicates that John the Baptist had a similar holy and devoted life and ministry to Elijah, although he did not perform any miracles, but he didn't have to, as his role was to point to the one who would.  He served purely as the herald of the king and the herald does not draw attention to himself.  `John 10:41`. “John did no miracle but things that John spake of this man were true”

John’s ministry was to the Jewish people to prepare the way for the Messiah – but the Messiah was rejected and so the herald of the king must come back and prepare the people again, and this second time the people will respond.  `Malachi 4:5-6` notes that this will occur before the Great Tribulation period. In addition he was to assist in making the disobedient just and more literally, “to make ready for the Lord a prepared people”.  `Zechariah 10:12`ff.

John denied he was Elijah in accordance with the Malachi expectation, `John 1:21`.  Jesus will however identify him exactly as Luke records here, as “Elijah in spirit and power”.  `Matthew 17:12, Mark 9:12`.  John will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, who will desire to come to Jesus – John will challenge all parents to consider their children’s fate if they fail to recognize their sinfulness, and fail to repent before the Lord.  He will challenge them to be obedient to Moses, David, Amos, Isaiah, and Solomon, and recognize their need of a Saviour.  `Psalm 10:16-18, 78:5-8, 111:10, Proverbs 2:1-11, Isaiah 29:22-24, Amos 4:12, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:18
    :bold:

Zechariah acted a little like Gideon here, but let us not be too hard on him, as he expected to die at any second Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, nor would Mary who did not ask for a sign.  Zechariah is beside himself, and has deep doubts about things, even though God has done this before with Hannah, Manoah and his wife, and with Abraham and Sarah.  He looked at this in a natural light and perspective, only thinking about his prayer as a forlorn hope, but deeply fearing his wife was just too old to bear any children.  

Zechariah was sincere in his desire behind his prayer, and he wanted to say to his lovely wife Elizabeth that he had really tried, but deep in his spirit he didn't think it was possible, and may have been doubly concerned at the angel’s appearance - for he was privately praying at the altar of incense rather than praying for the nation as he was supposed to, and he didn't even really believe what he was saying!  How gracious God is to us all!  `Hebrews 4:7-16`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:19
    :bold:

Gabriel identifies himself to Zechariah. He is the angel who taught Daniel [ see `Daniel 8:6, 9:21`] and also will appear to Mary [ see verse 26 below].  His name literally means “man of God”. He says that he stands in the presence of God as a personal servant/messenger and has been specifically sent to tell Zechariah the good news about the birth of John.  He uses the name that Zechariah would know from his own reading of the book of Daniel, and as he announces the coming of the herald of the King of kings, it is appropriate that it is Gabriel who gives the message.  `Daniel 9:20-27`.  The count down to Messiah coming is over – the date of his birth approaches, not long after the birth of the messenger.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:20
    :bold:

Zechariah asked for a sign and got one, he was deprived of the power of speech. We see his ability to speak return on the birth of his son John in verse 64.  There are consequences for not believing in the word of God through his messenger angels.  `Genesis 18:9-15, Numbers 20:12, Isaiah 7:9-16`. Unbelief is sin and sin has consequences.  “Whatever is not of faith is sin”.  `Romans 14:22-23, Galatians 3:2-11, Ephesians 2:8, Hebrews 3:7-4:2`.  The one clear and public job the priest had after burning incense each day was to go outside and stand on the temple steps and announce the Aaronic blessing upon the people.  `Numbers 6:24-26`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:21
    :bold:

The phrase “they marvelled while he tarried” is in the imperfect tense, meaning that they were constantly amazed and not a little frightened, that the priest had not reappeared, as the Talmud says that the priest remained only a short time in the sanctuary.  The priest did not hesitate or prolong his time, as he was to place the hot coals from the altar, sprinkle the incense as he prayed for the nation and not linger, but walk steadily to the door again.  He had a small bell attached to his garment to ensure that priests waiting outside could hear him moving about, and rescue him if he got anything wrong and died.  The thought of the people was that he had died.  No-one was expecting Gabriel to speak, as he had not spoken to man since the mid 500s BC.  The prophecy of `Daniel 9:24-26` had not been factored into anyone’s thinking.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:22
    :bold:

The crowd realised that he had seen a vision, as he signed to them, but was unable to speak the blessing from Numbers aloud. The word perceived is epignosis, which means that they understood - were very clear in the minds, they had a full knowledge of his seeing a vision.  His signing to them showed them further proof that he had seen a vision as he clearly indicated that he had seen an angel form the Lord.  The drama of this event is the first warning to Israel, at the heart of the temple that spoke of the coming of the Messiah and his work, would have got holy men going back to the prophetic words of the past.  By the time of Jesus birth they know that it is in Bethlehem that Messiah is to be born, and they realise that the words of Daniel are unfolding in their day.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:23
    :bold:

We noticed that even though he had been struck dumb Zechariah remained at his post as a Levitical priest serving until the time of his roster as a priest had been completed and then he went home to Elisabeth.  When a man was struck dumb he was treated as unfit for the priesthood and would be removed form his office, but as Zechariah had clearly communicated by sign language, and writing likely also, that he had seen an angel, he was permitted to continue his function, even though the debility disqualified all others.

Seeing what had happened, this also shows us that he had a great sense of responsibility, and that the change in his life at this point had come from God.  His service is lifted up a notch rather than being distracted by the angelic visitation.  Angelic messengers visiting mankind are very rare, for they are not needed often, and so when one comes it is with very solemn and significant information that requires life change on the part of the person visited.  Life is never the same after an angelic visitation, but worship continues and spiritual service increases.  The fruit of angelic words to any man or woman is that their worship and spiritual service increases in quantity and quality.  

The Greek word for ministration, “Leitourgia”, is where we get the English word “Liturgy”, or priestly function from.  It was a common word in ancient Greece for public religious or social service, the emphasis being on the fact that it was work for, or on behalf of/for the benefit of, the people. It is seen in `Hebrews 8:6, 9:21, Philippians 2:17, 30` and is common in the papyri for the service of the Egyptian priesthood.  All spiritual service is “other” focused, as we serve the Lord’s people on his behalf.  `John 21:15-22, 1 Corinthians 12:7-11, 18`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:24
    :bold:

The word for conceive is used eleven times by Luke, and in every case he is using it in the medical sense, in relation to the conception of a child.  It is used on five other occasions with James in `James 1:15` using it for lust “giving birth” to sin.  After Elisabeth had conceived John the Baptist she became reclusive for a period of five months, which was a common thing for older mothers to be encouraged to do, even today, to make sure there is no shock or accident that might create miscarriage – which increases in risk with age.  The Greek word translated hid “Perikrupto” indicates that she hid herself constantly. It is a composite verb with “krupto” meaning to hide and “peri” all around.  

It is not shame that causes this, but her awareness, from her husband’s communication by writing to her, that this child is important in the Plan of God.  This is no ordinary child and so she takes extra-ordinary precautions to ensure his and her own survival.  She doesn't crow about her pregnancy, but “goes underground”, and waits for the day to show herself and be assured that risk of miscarriage is now low, and she is ready to give birth to the messenger of Messiah. This is a woman who can handle the truth and walk humbly in it, and be aware that she is making history without any arrogance.  This couple are spiritually well chosen by the Lord for their duty to bring this boy up in spiritual depth.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:25
    :bold:

Barrenness was deeply felt by Jewish women because the husband wanted an heir and because the believers knew that eventually the Messiah would be born as well as the natural longing for a woman to become a mother.  The “desire of women” for Jewish women was the desire to be the mother of the Messiah, as the messianic expectation was high, and all knew that he had to come soon from the time ticking clock of `Daniel 9:24-26`.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

Both the Lord Jesus Christ and John the Baptist were totally qualified to undertake their respective roles in the plan of God.  Their parents in each case were spiritually chosen people, who could handle the solemn responsibility they were given to parent their sons.  Let us be worthy in our responsibility.  

We as Christians with specific gifts are uniquely gifted to undertake our function in the Plan of God. As with John, whether we function or not in the plan of God involves our volition and knowledge of God’s Plan.  We are to know the Word, believe the Word, and apply the Word.  `Hebrews 3:7-4:12`.

We should not be amazed at what God can do even in apparently impossible situations. We can do all things through Christ who strengthens us daily in the ministries of the Holy Spirit.  `Philippians 4:10-13`.

God can and will solve our problems and ease our heartaches if we are obedient to Him. We need to know our responsibilities to God and to be persistent and consistent in undertaking the tasks even at times of turbulence in our life knowing that all things do work together for good. `Romans 8:26-28`.

Elijah will return with Moses as the two heralds of the Second Advent of Christ. Your position in the Plan of God is of critical importance even though you may consider yourself a failure.  If we are alive we have a part to play in the plan still. Zechariah failed to believe and was struck dumb for a time, but he regained speech and he retained his ministry and gained the new one of bringing up his son in the spiritual family home that would nurture his own spiritual walk with God.
