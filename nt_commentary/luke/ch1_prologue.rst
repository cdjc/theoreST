Background and Analysis
-----------------------

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:1
    :bold:

In verse 1 we see that many had written down accounts of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ by the time Luke begins his record. We do not know how many but certainly more than the two or three who wrote the canonical gospels. The word translated “taken in hand” is a compound verb comprising “cheir” for hand and “epi” meaning upon.

Moreover the infinitive of “Anatassomai” shows that it was their purpose to set it out systematically, and that the account would be a full and complete one. This clearly indicates that others had set forth material in a systematic form rather than just notes and anecdotes.  `1 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:16-19`.

These were not fairy tales; this was the truth that was “most surely believed” by the followers of Christ. The word used here is used for finality, where a person is convinced, or fully persuaded about something. This means Luke was fully satisfied after thorough investigation that what he had received from others was true, and what he has studied and now written was also accurate and the truth.

Luke had two sources of information as an historian; both written 
material from others already in writing, and oral history from the eyewitnesses of the Lord’s ministry.  He will blend these two sources together in his Gospel account, as a record that Paul’s lawyer can use to explain to the Roman Court his client’s belief system and the legality of its tenants and origins.

    :bold:

Here we see that Luke did not claim himself to be an eyewitness but he had interviews with those who were. We note that the Greek word Paradidomi which is translated “delivered”, is made up of the Greek words for side by side, and to give. Luke says that here he has been handed down thoroughly reliable information both oral and written. He was a secondary and not primary witness to the events of the Gospel, but the material is totally reliable and not fables.  In the Acts record he will be an eye witness from Chapter 16 and will give us accurate indication of this.

The verb is also in the Aorist Active Indicative, which shows the active way in which they “came alongside” Luke, and the indicative mood says that this is a reality, they actually did it. In the second half of this verse the word “were” is the word Ginomai, which means to become something which they were not before. 

These people became eyewitnesses as soon as the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ commenced. They had been there from the beginning. This is an old Greek word, and means seeing with one’s own eyes. This is the only place we have it in the New Testament. This is the word we get the English word Autopsy from.

Of course they became eyewitnesses once the ministry started. Prior to that there was nothing to witness. As a result of what they saw they became disciples and became servants to the general public proclaiming the Word of God.  `Acts 26:16, 24-26, Ephesians 3:7-8, 4:11-12, Colossians 1:23-25`.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:3
    :bold:

Luke is seen to be motivated to write an account himself by the example and enthusiasm of the other reporters of the Life and Ministry of our Lord, but also because he has uncovered more stories than the others have recorded and he is excited by what he has learned about the faith that saved him. The word translated “seemed good” means that this is a natural conclusion and justification for Luke to write his gospel account – he has been “moved” to write.  `Psalm 40:5, 50:21`.

Luke first of all however thoroughly researched the whole subject, so that he knew thoroughly the subject he was going to systematically set out in his Gospel. In the Greek it means to follow a thing along in the mind and trace it carefully. In order means cconsecutively, much of Luke is chronological, but some is topical.  At this time historical accounts were ordered quite differently than today’s newspaper reporter, but Luke comes closest to a good investigative journalist.  He has an overall plan to start and he is filling the gaps with facts he has verified.  He wont record anything that he hasn't verified from someone who was there. 

The recipient of this treatise is a person called Theophilus, which means a person loved by God, but was also a common name of the time. He is also the recipient of Luke’s other canonical work, the Book of Acts. His title “Most Excellent” indicates that he was a high official in the Roman Government and may have been a title like “Your Excellency” [see Felix `Acts 23:26` and Festus `Acts 26:25`]. It is of interest that the adjective does not occur when Luke again addresses Theophilus in `Acts 1:1`.   The suspicion is that this man was the official lawyer for Paul’s case and that the Gospel and Acts are a legal brief to help defend Paul against the charges to be brought before the Emperor that he is guilty of spreading an illegal religion.

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:4
    :bold:

Here we have the word “Epignosis” which means a thorough working knowledge. We note it is in the subjunctive mood which shows that the free will of Theophilus is in focus. He had in fact received instruction in these things, at an earlier point of time as seen in the aorist active indicative of “Katecheo”.  Luke is fine tuning his knowledge that he might accurately and fully know the facts.  If this man is the lawyer appointed by the court he must be better prepared than the Jewish opponents he will face.

He therefore has a lot of information. Whether he now consolidates the academic knowledge on the subject to full working knowledge is however up to him. He has the information but Luke notes his free will is involved.

The word translated “certainty” is based on the Greek word Sphallo which means to fall or totter and with the negative prefix “a” means not to stagger, or to be uncertain.

The men doing the teaching were called catechists, based on the Greek word Katecheo, translated instructed in this and those receiving it catechumens. Whether Theophilus was in the second category is not known.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

We have not inherited fairy tales or fables in the Bible about the Lord Jesus Christ. We have substantial systematic and thorough information from leading eyewitnesses and in this case one of the greatest historians of all time, Luke.

Many people were led to write down detailed accounts but only a few of those accounts were inspired and recorded in the canon of Scripture. 

It is of the greatest importance that before you attest to a subject you investigate thoroughly so that you get a complete picture.

As a result of our meeting with the Lord Jesus Christ, the Living Word we are to be ministers of the Word.

In order to make proper decisions on a subject we need to have good solid information, then it is up to us as to whether we pursue it or not.

It is critical that the whole subject is researched and set out systematically. Hence verse by verse studies are the superior way to study the Scriptures.
