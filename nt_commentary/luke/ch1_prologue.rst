.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:1-4

Background and Analysis
-----------------------

.. biblepassage:: Luke 1:1
    :bold:

In verse 1 we see that many had written down accounts of the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ by the time Luke begins his record. We do not know how many but certainly more than the two or three who wrote the canonical gospels. The word translated “taken in hand” is a compound verb comprising “cheir” for hand and “epi” meaning upon.

Moreover the infinitive of “Anatassomai” shows that it was their purpose to set it out systematically, and that the account would be a full and complete one. This clearly indicates that others had set forth material in a systematic form rather than just notes and anecdotes.  `1 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:16-19`.

These were not fairy tales; this was the truth that was “most surely believed” by the followers of Christ. The word used here is used for finality, where a person is convinced, or fully persuaded about something. This means Luke was fully satisfied after thorough investigation that what he had received from others was true, and what he has studied and now written was also accurate and the truth.

Luke had two sources of information as an historian; both written 
material from others already in writing, and oral history from the eyewitnesses of the Lord’s ministry.  He will blend these two sources together in his Gospel account, as a record that Paul’s lawyer can use to explain to the Roman Court his client’s belief system and the legality of its tenants and origins.

    :bold:

Here we see that Luke did not claim himself to be an eyewitness but he had interviews with those who were. We note that the Greek word Paradidomi which is translated “delivered”, is made up of the Greek words for side by side, and to give. Luke says that here he has been handed down thoroughly reliable information both oral and written. He was a secondary and not primary witness to the events of the Gospel, but the material is totally reliable and not fables.  In the Acts record he will be an eye witness from Chapter 16 and will give us accurate indication of this.

The verb is also in the Aorist Active Indicative, which shows the active way in which they “came alongside” Luke, and the indicative mood says that this is a reality, they actually did it. In the second half of this verse the word “were” is the word Ginomai, which means to become something which they were not before. 

These people became eyewitnesses as soon as the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ commenced. They had been there from the beginning. This is an old Greek word, and means seeing with one’s own eyes. This is the only place we have it in the New Testament. This is the word we get the English word Autopsy from.

Of course they became eyewitnesses once the ministry started. Prior to that there was nothing to witness. As a result of what they saw they became disciples and became servants to the general public proclaiming the Word of God.  `Acts 26:16, 24-26, Ephesians 3:7-8, 4:11-12, Colossians 1:23-25`.
