Amen
~~~~

1. Amen means "so be it" or "I believe it".

#. It is used in three ways:

   a. By the hearer to indicate that we agree with what has been said (`Numbers 5:22; Deuteronomy 27:12-26, Revelation 5:14, 22:20`).

   b. Used in prayer to signify that we believe our prayers will be heard and answered by God (`Psalm 41:13; Jeremiah 28:6`). This is the meaning of the "amen" at the end of a prayer by one who leads in prayer, or by the congregation (`1 Chronicles 16:36; Nehemiah 8:6; 1 Corinthians 14:16`).

   c. Amen is used in (`Revelation 3:14`) as a name for our Lord Jesus Christ, as our security for this life and the guarantee that our life hereafter rests in Him (`2 Corinthians 1:20`).
