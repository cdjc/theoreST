Eternal life
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Mankind was created by God to enjoy fellowship with Him forever (`2 Peter 3:9`).

#. Entry into eternal life is by faith in Christ (`John 3:36, 5:24, Acts 13:46, Galatians 6 :8, Matthew 25 :46`).

#. Those who are serious about life and death ask about it (`Matthew 13:40-43, 19:16, Mark 10:17, Luke 10:25, 18:18`).

#. The Lord provides the answer to questions about life and death (`John 6:68, Romans 5:20,21, Romans 6:22,23`).

#. It is the Lord who gives eternal life (`John 5:39, 40, John 12:50`).

#. Believers have eternal life now, as a present possession (`1 John 5:11-13`). This guarantees our salvation.

#. Eternal life is received in full at the rapture/resurrection when we all receive our new bodies from the Lord.

#. We are all urged to live each day with the eternal life perspective in mind, thinking of our place with the Lord forever (`Matthew 19:29, 30, Mark 10:29-31, John 12:25, John 4:36, Romans 2:6,7`).
