Brotherhood of Believers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. All believers are referred to as brothers (gk *adelphos*), the Greek word used indicating family relationship with both male and female included. As members of the same family who will rule throughout all eternity together it is of the greatest importance to have a special attitude towards our fellow believers. (`1 Peter 2:5, 9-10, Revelation 5:10`)

#. This attitude should be one of agape love or caring for the ultimate well being of others. (`1 Peter 2:17, 3:8, 1 John 3:23, 4:12`)

#. We are our brothers keepers, not by way of interference but by being active and alert for their good. (`Genesis 4:9`, compare `James 5:20, 2 Thessalonians 3:15`)

#. Because of family closeness there is a danger that one member may lead another astray, so discipline is required. (`1 Corinthians 5:11`)

#. In our family there must be a readiness to forgive. (`Matthew 18:21`)

#. The world has its own brotherhood of evil and sin. (`John 15:19`)

#. The soul and fruit of a person shows the family to which they belong. (`Matthew 12:33`)

#. All of us were born into Adam's family. (`1 Corinthians 15:22`)

#. We either stay there in sin or become a member of the Lord's family. (`John 8:42-44`)
