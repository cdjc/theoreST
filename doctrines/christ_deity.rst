#. Jesus lived on earth in total dependence upon God the Father. He never used His own divine attributes in contradiction to the will of the Father. (`Matthew 4:1-11, 27:42-43`)

#. At the birth of Christ no change occurred in the deity of Jesus Christ. During His earthly life, some attributes were unused but they were never deleted or destroyed. To remove any attribute from His deity would be to destroy deity.

#. Jesus Christ is true humanity. This includes attributes such as thirst, hunger, weariness. (`John 19:28`)

#. Jesus Christ had a body, soul and spirit, but no old sin nature. He did not receive an old sin nature because of the virgin birth.

#. God became flesh, it is not a case of God merely possessing humanity.
