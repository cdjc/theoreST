Spirituality
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. All Christians have the Holy Spirit indwelling them. When we allow Him to control our lives, we are said to be "filled with the Spirit" or "walking in the Spirit".

#. The filling of the Holy Spirit can be lost by:

   a. Grieving the Spirit - by sin

   #. Quenching the Spirit - by not submitting to His leading

   #. This is called being carnal, or controlled by the flesh, the old sin nature.


#. The filling of the Holy Spirit can be regained by:

   a. confessing sin (`1 John 1:9`)

   #. surrendering your life to God (`Romans 12:1-2`)

   #. This is called being spiritual, or controlled by the Holy Spirit.


#. Only the Holy Spirit in us can produce good works acceptable to God - anything in our own strength is unacceptable (`Romans 8:8-9, 1 Corinthians 3:10-15`).

#. The spiritual believer:

   a. Imitates God (`Ephesians 5:1, 1 John 3:9`)

   #. To glorify Christ (`John 7:39, John 16:14`)

   #. Fulfills the Law (`Romans 8:2-4, Romans 13:8`).
