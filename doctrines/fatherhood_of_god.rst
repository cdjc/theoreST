Fatherhood of god
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The Father over creation - all beings get their life and very existence from God (`Ephesians 3:14, James 1:17`).

#. The Father of Israel - `Exodus 4:22` - Israel is my son - this is my firstborn. God has a special relationship with Israel.

#. Protecting and caring for the nation. However, not all Jews are saved.

#. The Father of the Lord Jesus Christ (`Ephesians 1:3`).

   a. This indicates the roles within the Trinity - the Father God in control, and the obedient Son Of God who obeyed the Father's plan and purpose.

   #. It also shows the intimate relationship of love and dependence between the earthly Jesus and His true Father in heaven.


#. The Father of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ (`Romans 8:15, Galatians 4:6-7`)

   a. Only in Christ do we become brothers (`Galatians 3:27-29`). This is the result of the Holy Spirit who baptizes us into the body of Christ and makes us a new creation in Him (`1 Corinthians 12:13, Ephesians 4:5`).

   #. God is not the spiritual father of the unregenerate man, they are His creation but not His children (`John 14:6`). Before salvation we were sons of our sinful nature (`John 8:42-47, Ephesians 2:19`).
