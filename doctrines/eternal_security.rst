Eternal security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. When a person truly trusts Jesus Christ for salvation, he is saved forever. He cannot lose his salvation.

#. POSITIONAL APPROACH (`Romans 8:38-39`)

   We are united with Christ ("in Christ"). Absolutely nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ.

#. LOGICAL APPROACH (`Romans 8:32, Romans 5`)

   As unbelievers we are enemies of God (`Romans 5`), as believers we are his children. If he did the most for his enemies what will he do for his children? This excludes loss of salvation for he saved us while we were his enemies.

#. GOD'S HANDS APPROACH (`John 10:28, Psalm 37:24`)

   Neither shall anyone seize them out of my hand. God is all-powerful.

#. EXPERIENTIAL APPROACH (`2 Timothy 2:12-13`)

   If we deny Christ He is going to deny us rewards (context=suffering and rewards). If we renounce Him, HE REMAINS FAITHFUL. The believer is in Christ and Christ indwells the believer. He cannot deny Himself.

#. THE FAMILY APPROACH (`Galatians 3:26, John 1:12`)

   When you believe in Christ you are born again as a child of God. You cannot be unborn, once a child always a child.

#. THE INHERITANCE APPROACH (`1 Peter 1:4-5`)

   We have an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled which fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for us who are kept by the power of God. Perfect tense - it will always be reserved, since it is kept by God, not us.

#. THE SOVEREIGNTY APPROACH (`2 Peter 3:9, Jude 24`)

   He is not willing that any should perish - refers to the whole human race (`2 Peter 3:9`) Now unto him who is able to keep you from falling (from perishing). Once you are saved, it is His will that you don't perish.

#. THE BODY APPROACH (`1 Corinthians 12:21, Colossians 1:18`)

   Christ is the head, we are the members of the body. If any are lost, the body of Christ is incomplete.

#. THE GREEK TENSE APPROACH (`Ephesians 2:8-9`)

   "For by Grace are ye saved." Perfect tense of the verb "sozo". For by Grace have you been saved in the past so that you go on being saved forever.

#. THE SEALING MINISTRY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT APPROACH (`2 Corinthians 1:22, Ephesians 1:13, 4:30`)

   In the ancient world the seal was a guarantee for protection. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit guarantees our security.
