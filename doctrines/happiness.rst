Happiness
~~~~~~~~~

1. This is the state of well being in the soul when the person is content in whatever situation they find themselves.

#. True happiness is unrelated to the circumstances of life (`Philippians 4:11, 12, Hebrews 13:5, 6`).

#. The Lord has promised to provide everything we NEED (`2 Corinthians 9:8`).

#. Even in pain and persecution the truly mature believer can be happy (`1 Peter 3:14, 4:14, Psalms 146:5, Proverbs 16:20, 28:14`).

#. The more we know God the more truly happy we will be in this life (`Psalms 43:4, 1 Timothy 6:15, 16`).

#. Many consider that great wealth, position or education will ensure happiness. King Solomon searched for happiness in all of these things, and concluded that true happiness can only be found in God.

   a. EXPERIMENT 1 - EDUCATION (`Ecclesiastes 1:12-18`)

      i. Solomon introduces himself as the king and states that he undertook many educational courses. By hard study he attains a high standard in all his subjects but finds, with improved vocabulary, he is able to explain more to others how sad he is.

      #. Solomon's conclusion on education - "All vanity and vexation of spirit" (`v 14|Ecclesiastes 1:14`). Education does not produce happiness.


   #. EXPERIMENT 2 - PLEASURE (`Ecclesiastes 2:1 -11`)

      i. Having spent time with study, Solomon decides to relax and pursue pleasure. He seeks pleasure in laughter (`v 2|Ecclesiastes 2:2`), wine (`v 3|Ecclesiastes 2:3`), great buildings (`vs 4-6|Ecclesiastes 2:4-6`), servants (`vs 7-9|Ecclesiastes 2:7-9`).

      #. Solomon's conclusion: "All vanity and vexation of spirit" (`v 11|Ecclesiastes 2:11`). Pleasure does not produce happiness.


   #. EXPERIMENT 3 - A POSTERITY (`Ecclesiastes 2:12-26`)

      i. Solomon reflects that when his time came he would die just as the foolish man. When that day came, unless he had a number of children, he would be forgotten, together with his works. Solomon becomes depressed. He is sleepless at night and comes to the conclusion that one should eat, drink and be merry to eke out a little happiness.

      #. Solomon's conclusion: "all vanity and vexation of spirit" (`v 26|Ecclesiastes 2:26`). Posterity does not produce happiness.


   #. EXPERIMENT 4 - PHILOSOPHY (`Ecclesiastes 3:1-22`)

      i. Solomon, in his philosophy, starts with facts and degenerates through rationalism to agnosticism.

      #. He commences with looking at man in time. God's eternal existence, provision and future judgment of the world is given. (`vs 13-15|Ecclesiastes 3:13-15`). By (`v 19|Ecclesiastes 3:19`) however, Solomon has degenerated to common origin evolution that man is just another member of the animal kingdom and his future destiny is exactly the same as the animals (`v 20|Ecclesiastes 3:20`).

      #. He arrives at agnosticism (`v 21|Ecclesiastes 3:21`) and finally humanism (`v 22|Ecclesiastes 3:22`) where he "perceives [that there is nothing better than a man should rejoice in his own works".

      #. Solomon concludes this in `Chapter 4|Ecclesiastes 4` with "This also is vanity and vexation of spirit." Philosophy does not produce happiness.


   #. EXPERIMENT 5 - MONEY (`Ecclesiastes 5:10-16`)

      i. Solomon who was one of the richest people who ever lived, soon concludes that money or wealth does not bring happiness. He finds that wealth does not satisfy (`v 10|Ecclesiastes 5:10`), you support more and more people (`v 11|Ecclesiastes 5:11`), you do not sleep well at night (`v 12|Ecclesiastes 5:12`). When you die you cannot take your wealth with you (`v 15|Ecclesiastes 5:15`).

      #. Solomon concluded money does not produce happiness.


   #. EXPERIMENT 6 - A GOOD REPUTATION (`Ecclesiastes 7:1-15`)

      i. With the forming of a good reputation over a long period of time, it is necessary to act in a sober, serious way (`vs 2-5|Ecclesiastes 7:2-5`) rather than in a light-hearted, flippant way. By (`v 15|Ecclesiastes 7:15`) however, Solomon has found that a good reputation does not ensure success or happiness.

      #. Solomon concluded a good reputation does not produce happiness.


   #. EXPERIMENT 7 - MORALITY (`Ecclesiastes 8:9-15`)

      i. Solomon observes that whilst the wicked will be punished in life many times, the wicked succeed and prosper to the human eye whilst the moral do not. He believes this is not fair (`v 14|Ecclesiastes 8:14`) and as a consequence, returns to his solution of eating, drinking and making merry.

      #. Solomon concludes that morality does not produce happiness.



#. THE TRUE SOURCE OF HAPPINESS (`Ecclesiastes 12:13-14`)

   Having examined a whole range of ways which the world believes will make you happy, Solomon concludes: "Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil. " In this, Solomon is reflecting the principle of (`Joshua 1:8`).
