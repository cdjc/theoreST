Bible: inspiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The principle of inspiration is found in (`2 Timothy 3:16`) "All Scripture is God breathed" - Gk. THEO PNEUSTOS.

   The Holy Spirit communicated to the human authors God's complete plan (`2 Samuel 23:2, 3, Isaiah 59:21, Jeremiah 1:9, Matthew 22:42, 43, Mark 12:36, Acts 4:24, 25, 28:25`).

   The human authors of Scripture so wrote that in spite of their personalities, they were able to communicate God's plan with perfect accuracy in the language they wrote.

#. The origin of Scripture is beyond human viewpoint (`2 Peter 1:20, 21`).

#. The Bible is the mind of Christ (`1 Corinthians 2:16`). Therefore it is the absolute standard for believers (`Psalm 138:2`).

#. Pre-canon revelation from God occurred through the Holy Spirit. There was no written scripture until the time of Moses (2Samuel 23:2, `Ezekiel 2:2, 8:3, 11:1, 24, Micah 3:8, Hebrews 3:7`).

#. Four categories of Old Testament revelation:

   a. The spoken word - thus saith the Lord (`Isaiah 6:9, 10, Acts 28:25`).

   #. Dreams (`Numbers 12:6, Genesis 15:12, 31:10-13, 31:24, Daniel 10:9`) - whilst asleep.

   #. Visions (`Isaiah 1:1, 6:1, 1 Kings 22:19`) - whilst awake.

   #. Angelic teaching (`Deuteronomy 33:2, Acts 7:53, Galatians 3:19, Psalm 68:17`).


#. The extent of revelation:

   a. The unknown past - the Bible portrays past historical details unknown to man apart from revelation (Genesis chapters 1-11). The accuracy of these historical facts is guaranteed by inspiration, e.g. Creation, Noah's Flood.

   #. Ancient history - whilst the Bible is not a text book of history, all historical citations are accurate.

   #. Objective law - the Old Testament contains many laws for both individuals and national life. These laws express perfectly the mind of God to those people to whom they are addressed.

   #. Some portions of the Bible contain direct quotations from God. The doctrine of inspiration guarantees that such quotations are properly recorded exactly as God desired.

   #. God uses the emotions, trials and triumphs of certain believers to declare His grace in devotional literature like the Psalms, Song of Solomon

   #. Inspiration extends to the recording of falsehoods just as they were uttered - Satan `Genesis 3:4`.

   #. Inspiration guarantees the accuracy of all recorded prophecies.
