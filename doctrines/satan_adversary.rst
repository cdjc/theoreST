Satan - adversary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. SCRIPTURE - `Genesis 3`; `Isaiah 14`; `Ezekiel 28`; `Matthew 4`; Revelation.

#. BIOGRAPHY

   Satan is the most beautiful creature ever to be created by God. He is an angel who rebelled against God before the creation of man (`Isaiah 14:12-15`). Originally he was the covering angel, the personal attendant of Jesus Christ in the very throne room of God. Unlike God, Satan is a created being and as such can only be in one place at any one time. He is attended by a vast number of angels (called demons) who have given him unswerving allegiance. After the creation of man, he tempted Adam and Eve to be as gods and to know good and evil by disobeying God. Satan then became the ruler of this world (`Genesis 3:1-7`). He attacked the human race in many ways prior to the birth of Jesus Christ. Throughout Jesus Christ's life, Satan attacked the Lord. Since Christ's victory at the cross he attacks believers. Satan still has access into heaven where he accuses the brethren. Halfway through the tribulation period Satan is thrown out of heaven (`Revelation 12:7-9`). This causes him to intensify his attack on the human race. During the millennium he is confined to the bottomless pit, allowing a perfect environment on the earth (`Revelation 20:1-3`). After a brief rebellion at the end of the millennium (`Revelation 20:7-10`), Satan is condemned to the eternal lake of fire which was created for the devil and his angels.

#. PRINCIPLES

   a. Believers are in Christ and therefore in a position of supremacy over Satan (`Romans 8:37`).

   #. Satan was defeated at the cross once and for all (`Colossians 2:14,15`).

   #. He can therefore only use devices and schemes, trying to convince the believer that he can still win the battle against God.

   #. Satan, through religion, tries to get man to work independently from God.

   #. A Christian out of fellowship can promote principles proposed by Satan (`Matthew 4:8-10; Mark 8:33`).

   #. Satan will use Scripture slightly changed, or added to, to try and confuse believers and lead them astray (`Matthew 4:3-10` cf. `Psalm 91:11,12`).

   #. If Satan the adversary is resisted he will flee from you (`James 4:7`).

   #. Knowledge and application of the Scriptures is essential in understanding the wiles of the devil (`Ephesians 6:11`).
