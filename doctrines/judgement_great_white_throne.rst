Judgement: great white throne
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The judgement of the Great White Throne is the last judgement. (`Revelation 20:11, 15`)

#. Only the unsaved are judged at the last judgement as there is no judgement for Christians. (`Romans 8:1`)

#. The last judgement occurs at the end of the Millennium. (`Revelation 20:7-15`)

#. The unsaved are judged according to their works from the Books of Works. (`Revelation 20:12`)

#. The judgement is to show that the Human works of man cannot satisfy the justice of God. God is totally fair and shows that he is only satisfied by "The Good Work" - the death of Christ on the Cross.

#. Having shown the unsaved they have failed to satisfy the holiness of God, the condemned are cast into the Lake of Fire. (`Revelation 20:15`)
