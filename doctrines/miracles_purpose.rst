Miracles: purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Miracles occurred mainly in three periods of history. Of all the miracles recorded in the Scriptures all but twelve fall into the following three periods.

   a. The Law and Prophets Group:- prepares for the coming of the Lord

      i. At the Exodus through to the giving of the Law, miracles were performed by Moses, Aaron and later by Joshua.

      #. At the period when the great prophets Elijah and Elisha were teaching many miracles were performed.


   #. The Lord and Church Group:- bears witness to His first coming

      i. The miracles of the Lord.

      #. The miracles performed by the apostles.


   #. The Future Miracle Group:- attest to His second coming

      i. Beginning with the activities of the two witnesses of the Great Tribulation.

      #. The universal outburst of miracle activity at the establishment of the Millennial Kingdom, when the Lord rules over a restored earth.



#. Their purpose includes the following.

   a. To glorify the nature of God (`John 2:11, 11:40`).

   #. To accredit certain men as spokesmen for God (`Hebrews 2:3-4, Luke 7:18-23`)

   #. To provide evidence for belief in Jesus as Messiah (`John 6:2,14, 10:37-38, 20:30-31, 1 Corinthians 15:13-20`)

   #. To demonstrate the Lord's superiority over the forces of evil. (`Matthew 9:27-34; Mark 5:1-20; Luke 4:31-37`)

   #. To demonstrate the uniqueness of the Lord Jesus Christ, God with us. (`John 1:14`)


#. Miracles demonstrate the attributes of God:

   a. The Sovereignty of God was illustrated in:-

      i. the Lord's creative work of turning water into wine at Cana. (`John 2:1-11`)

      #. His power when stilling the storm on Galilee. (`Mark 4:35-41; Matthew 8:18`)

      #. the feeding of the 5000 and the 4000. (`Mark 6:33-44; 8:1-9`)

      #. walking on the water at Galilee. (`Mark 6:47-52`)

      #. His arrest in Gethsemane. (`John 18:6`)


   #. The Righteousness of God was illustrated in: the Lord's transfiguration before the disciples on the mountain, when they saw the Holiness of God in the Lord displayed. (`Matthew 17:1-8; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36`)

   #. The Justice of God was illustrated in: the cursing of the fig tree during the last week before the cross as a sign of His coming judgment upon unresponsive Israel. (`Matthew 21:18-22; Mark 11:12-14, 20-26`)

   #. The Love of God was illustrated in: all the healing ministries as the Lord's compassion flowed into action, even to the exhaustion of His humanity. While thirty-six specific miracles of the Lord are recorded, many thousands of healing miracles are passed over in a few isolated verses. (eg. `Matthew 9:35-36, 14:14, 15:30-31, 8:16-17` etc.)

   #. The Eternal Life of God was illustrated in: the great miracle of the resurrection of Christ.

   #. The Omniscience of God was illustrated in:

      i. his knowledge of where unseen shoals of fish were. (`Matthew 4:18-22, Mark 1:16-20, John 21:1-14`)

      #. where the fish was with just enough money in its mouth to pay the required tax. (`Matthew 17:24-27`)

      #. the knowledge about Nathaniel and the woman at the well at Sychar also shows his omniscience. (`John 1:45-51; 4:5-43`)


   #. The Omnipresence of God was illustrated in: His ability to appear in various places many kilometres apart demonstrating the truth of His promise to be with believers always. (`Matthew 28:20`)

   #. The Omnipotence of God was illustrated in: the raising of people such as Lazarus from the dead.

   #. The Immutability of God was illustrated in: the repetition of the miracle of the draught of fishes both before and after the resurrection showing that His character and power were unchanged.

   #. The Veracity of God was illustrated in: the healing of the Centurion's servant and the Nobleman's son. The Lord said they were healed, and at that moment, many kilometres away, they were. (`Matthew 8:5-13, Luke 7:1-10, John 4:46-54`)

   #. The Grace of God was illustrated in: the healing of Malchus' ear in the garden on the night of the Lord's arrest (`Luke 22:50`). It was a testimony to His Grace that as he faced the horror of the cross, our Lord could still stoop and heal one of His captors. It is significant that the last recorded miracle performed by the Lord before the cross benefited an enemy, one who had come to arrest him.
