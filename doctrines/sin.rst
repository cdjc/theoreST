Sin
~~~

1. Sin means to fall short (like an arrow falling short of the target) of the glory of God (`Romans 3:23`).

#. Therefore, anything which does not meet God's standard of righteousness and holiness is sin.

#. It is clear to see, then, that mankind, in his own strength, cannot achieve the righteousness of God (`Romans 3:9-10`).

#. The sin of Adam:

   a. Sin entered the world with Adam (`Genesis 3:1-5, Romans 5:12`).

   #. The penalty of sin is death (`Romans 6:23`)

      i. spiritual death - separation from God in time (`Genesis 3:8`)

      #. physical death - separation of the soul from the body (`Genesis 3:19, 5:5`)

      #. eternal death - separation from God in the Lake of Fire `Revelation 20:13-14`).


   #. The man, Adam, as head over the woman, was therefore held responsible for sin (`Romans 5:12`).

   #. The penalty of sin is imputed to all people, and, apparently, passed down through the male in birth.

   #. Because Jesus was born of a virgin, He did not inherit the sin nature from Adam.

   #. As a sinless man, He was therefore qualified to offer Himself as a sacrifice to pay the penalty of sin (death - spiritual and physical).

   #. Because Christ has paid the penalty for sin for us, those who trust in Him are no longer condemned (`Romans 5:19, 8:1`).


#. All of creation is corrupted as a result of sin (`Genesis 3:16-19, Romans 8:20-22`).

#. Three types of sin:-

   a. Adam's sin is imputed to all mankind

   #. As a result, we all inherit a sinful nature

   #. As a result, we therefore commit personal sins.


#. Sin manifests itself in three categories:-

   a. Sins of action/deed:-

      i. Examples include murder, adultery, stealing


   #. Sins of the tongue/spoken:-

      i. Examples include lying, slander, gossip, blasphemy

      #. Out of the seven "worst" sins, three are sins of the tongue (`Proverbs 6:16-19`)

      #. Can result in the sin unto death (`Psalm 12:3`)

      #. God protects and blesses the believer who is victimised by the sins of the tongue (`Matthew 5:11-12`)

      #. Troublemakers are always characterised by sins of the tongue (`Psalm 52:2`).


   #. Sins of the mind:-

      i. Examples include pride, coveting, jealousy, bitterness, hatred, vindictiveness.



#. Recovery from in:-

   a. When a believer sins his fellowship with God is disrupted. The Holy Spirit is grieved, and can no longer control your life.

   #. Confess the known sin (`1 John 1:9, Psalm 66:18`) God forgives these sins upon confession and cleanses from the unknown sins in the believer's life as well as known sins.

   #. Examine your motivation - this involves full surrender to God (`Romans 12:1-2, 2 Corinthians 13:5`).

   #. Move on from the sin which you have confessed. Don't get tied up with guilt - this is another sin. (`Philippians 3:13-14, Psalm 103:10-12`)

   #. Resume your active spiritual walk. Avoid areas where you might be tempted. (`Hebrews 12:12-13`)

   #. Be reconciled to others once you have been reconciled to God (`James 5:16`).

   #. In human forgiveness we are told to forgive others even as God has forgiven us (`Ephesians 4:32`).


#. Jesus washed the feet of the disciples (`John 13:10`):-

   a. The body is clean - we were eternally forgiven once and for all at the cross (`Hebrews 10:1-12`).

   #. The feet need regular washing - we must confess our sins to the Father to restore fellowship (1`John 1:9`).


#. Satan constantly accuses us of our sins before God (`Revelation 12:10`). However, the Lord Jesus Christ is our Advocate/Lawyer in heaven (`1 John 2:1`). He pleads for us by saying that the penalty for that sin has been paid in full.

#. Names for sin include:-

   a. Unbelief - denial of the truth. (`John 16:9, Hebrews 3:12`)

   #. Lawlessness - rejection of rules of life. (`1 Timothy 1:9`)

   #. Iniquity - evil acts. (`Acts 8:22, 23`)

   #. Trespass - encroachment on God's authority. (`Ephesians 2:1`)

   #. Disobedience - refusal to obey. (`Hebrews 2:2`)

   #. Transgression - violation of law. (`Luke 15:29, Galatians 3:19`)


#. The sin unto death is the physical death of a believer, due to habitual unconfessed sin or rebellion against God. (`1 John 5:16, 17, 1 Corinthians 11:31, 32`) Examples:

   a. The Corinthian Pervert - (`1 Corinthians 5`)

   #. The Corinthians who habitually came to the Lord's table in an unworthy manner (`1 Corinthians 11:27-32`)

   #. Moses (`Deuteronomy 32:48-52`)

   #. Achan (`Joshua 7:16-26`)

   #. Ananias and Sapphira (`Acts 5:1 -11`).


#. There is only one sin which can't be forgiven - the unpardonable sin - rejection of Jesus Christ.

   a. It is based upon rejection of the ministry of the Holy Spirit to reveal the Lord Jesus Christ as God and Saviour. `Genesis 6:3, John 16:7-11, Hebrews 10:29`.

   #. Synonyms for the unpardonable sin are: willful sin (`Hebrews 10:26-31`), blasphemy against the Holy Spirit (`Matthew 12:31`), resisting the Holy Spirit (`Acts 7:51`), insulting the Holy Spirit (`Hebrews 10:29`).


#. The first recorded sin was that of Satan - pride (`Isaiah 14:12-14`).

#. God is not the author of sin nor the author of temptation. It is incompatible with the nature of God for Him to create sin because of His divine character. (`James 1:13`)

#. Temptation comes from the world, the flesh (sin nature within man), or Satan. If he entertains the sin, man then chooses to sin - sin is therefore a result of man's own free will. (`James 1:14`)
