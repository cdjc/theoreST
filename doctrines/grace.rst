Grace
~~~~~

1. DEFINITION: Grace is all that God is free to do for man on the basis of the cross. Therefore Grace is unmerited favour from God.

#. CONCEPT: Grace depends on the character of God therefore Grace depends on who and what God is. Grace is what God can do for man and still be true to his own character.

#. MAN AND GRACE: The believer must recognise the difference between legalism and grace. Legalism is man's work intruding upon the plan of God.

#. GRACE AND SANCTIFICATION: Under this concept the greatest thing God can do for the saved person is to make him exactly like His Son Jesus Christ. This is accomplished in three stages of sanctification.

   a. Positional Sanctification: At Salvation every believer enters into union with Christ. (`Hebrews 1:2`) Jesus Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father and is therefore superior to all angels in his humanity. At the point of salvation we are entered into union with Christ thus we are positionally higher than angels. We are positionally seated with Christ at God's right hand.

   #. Experiential Sanctification: During the Christian's life on the earth the time spent under the power of the Holy Spirit. During this time we produce the character of God in our lives - gold, silver, precious stones. (`1 Corinthians 3:12-15`)

   #. Ultimate Sanctification: When the believer receives a resurrection body he loses the Old Sin Nature and all human good. At this point the believer is physically superior to all angels. He remains in this perfect state eternally.


#. GRACE AND THE BELIEVER All believers have tasted of Grace at least once (`1 Peter 2:3`). This refers to the point of Salvation at which the believer receives at least 34 things which he did not earn or deserve. (`Ephesians 2:8, 9`) Disorientation to grace is the believer's greatest occupational hazard in his Christian life. (`Galatians 5:4, Hebrews 12:15`)

#. THE DIVINE ATTITUDE TO GRACE is expressed in (`Isaiah 30:18, 19`) God is constantly waiting to pour out his blessing on all believers in the Christian life.

#. GRACE IN SALVATION is expressed in many ways. It is always the same - believing in Jesus Christ (`Psalm 103:8-12, Romans 3:23-24, 4:4, 5:20, Ephesians 2:8, 9`)

#. THERE ARE MANY WAYS in which the Christian life expresses GRACE:

   Prayer (`Hebrews 4:16`)

   Suffering (`2 Corinthians 12:9, 10`)

   Growth (`2 Peter 3:18`)

   Stability (`1 Peter 5:12`)

   Lifestyle (`Hebrews 12:28, 2 Corinthians 1:12`)

   Production of Divine Good (`1 Corinthians 15:10, 2 Corinthians 6:1`)

#. GRACE AND GIVING (`2 Corinthians 8,9`) Grace is the correct attitude in relation to giving.

#. GRACE IN SUFFERING (`2 Corinthians 12:7-10`):Grace is the only means of coping with suffering in the Christian life. Through Grace God is able to bless the believer in the midst of the pressures and adversities of life. (`1 Peter 1:6,7`)

#. IMPLICATIONS OF GRACE:

   a. God is perfect, his plan is perfect.

   #. A perfect plan can only originate from a perfect God.

   #. If man could do anything in the plan of God the plan would no longer be perfect.

   #. A plan is no stronger than its weakest link. Grace therefore excludes all human merit, all human ability.

   #. Legalism, human works is the enemy of Grace.

   #. The works of human righteousness have therefore no place in the plan of God. (`Isaiah 64:6`)

   #. All human good is associated with the sin of pride.


#. THERE ARE THREE AREAS IN WHICH PRIDE REJECTS GRACE:

   a. The pride of the believer who rejects eternal security.

   #. The pride of the believer who succumbs to pressure and adversity.

   #. The pride of the believer who thinks the power of the world system is greater than spirituality.
