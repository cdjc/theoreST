Apostleship
~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Apostleship is the highest spiritual gift ever to exist in the Church. - Like all other spiritual gifts it was sovereignly bestowed by the Holy Spirit to certain individuals (`1 Corinthians 12:11, Ephesians 4:11, 1 Corinthians 12:28`)

#. Apostleship was a temporary gift. It was designed to carry the church until the canon of Scripture was completed. It had the total authority for directing the pre-canon church. Now the absolute authority is the canon of Scripture, particularly the New Testament.

#. Time of appointment:- The apostles to the church were appointed after the resurrection of Jesus Christ (`Ephesians 4:8`) Hence, they must be distinguished from the "Apostles to Israel" in (`Matthew 10:2` ff.)

#. The extent of the gift:- This spiritual gift exercised authority aver all local churches. Once the canon of Scripture was complete the gift was removed. Today all local churches are autonomous with authority vested in the canon of Scripture and the local pastor (`1 Corinthians 13:10`)

#. The qualification of apostles:- Apostles had to be eye witnesses to the resurrection of Christ. This qualified the eleven, Paul being qualified on the Damascus Road (`Acts 1:22, 1 Corinthians 9:1, 1 Corinthians 15:8,9`)

#. The authority of the apostles:- The authority was established by the possession of certain temporary gifts that went with this gift. Apostles also had the gifts of miracles, healing and tongues (`Acts 5:15, 16:16-18, 28:8,9`)

#. The roster of apostles:- We have the eleven (excluding Judas). Mathias was elected but he was not an apostle. The twelfth apostle was Paul (`1 Corinthians 15:7-10`). Paul was appointed by God on the road to Damascus to replace Judas Iscariot.

#. Others:- There were others who were delegated authority from the apostles and therefore, in a sense, exercised some apostolic authority when they were sent on apostolic missions. They include Barnabas (`Galatians 2:9`), James (half brother of Jesus) (`1 Corinthians 15:7, Galatians 1:19`), Apollos (`1 Corinthians 4:6`), Silas and Timothy (`1 Thessalonians 1:1`).
