#. Dress of the High Priest (`Exodus 28`)

   Except on ceremonial occasions, the dress of the priests and the high priest was no different from that of the common people. On ceremonial occasions the High Priest's uniform consisted of the following: white linen shorts, a white linen coat approximately hip length, a belt in the same colour as the curtains - white, blue, scarlet and purple, a turban-like cap with a golden crown inscribed 'Holy to Jehovah' (his badge of rank), an ephod of blue lavishly embroidered with colours, a breastplate of gold and cloth with the twelve stones representing the tribes engraved with their names and fastened with gold clasp. (see Priestly Garments).

#. The consecration of the priests and High Priests described in (`Exodus 29`)

#. The Day of Atonement (`Leviticus 16`) On that high holy day, the high priest donned his ceremonial robes and entered the Tabernacle where he sprinkled the blood of the bullock of the sin offering for himself over the top of the mercy seat. (v6, 14). If he emerged from the Holy of Holies his priesthood was assured for another year. He re-entered a second time with the blood of the goat of the sin offering for the people to do likewise for them. His return to the Israelites signified that he had obtained national pardon. The people of Israel were spared. (v30).

#. The descendants of the High Priest

   a. Succession occurred upon the officiating high priest's death with the eldest surviving son's installation. (`Numbers 20:28`)

   #. The line was promised to pass down through Phinehas eldest son of Eleazer, the son of Aaron. (`Numbers 25:10-13`). Eli was a legitimate priest and descendant of Ithmar, but not an high priest; the switch in the time took place during Saul's reign. It was rightfully restored to the line of Eleazer during Solomon's reign. (`1 Kings 2:26, 27, 35`). When Israel was about to go under dispersion in Jeremiah's day, Seraiah was high priest. He was captured by Nebuzar-adam and executed at Riblah. (`2 Kings 25:18-21`). His son Josedech, who should have inherited the office, never served as high priest but lived and died in captivity at Babylon. (`Haggai 1:1-14`). His son Joshua assumed the office when the High Priesthood was restored in the days of Zechariah and Zerubbabel. (`Zechariah 3`. )

   #. His successors were Jothum, Eliashia, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, who served in time of Alexander the Great. He met Alexander's conquering army with a scroll of Daniel in his hand. By reading him those passages dealing with him Jaddua won Alexander's friendship for the Jews.

   #. Jaddua's successors were Onias I and Simon the Just. Onias II, too young to become the high priest, was set aside in favour of Simon's brother Eleazer.

   #. The high priesthood was passed down to the Asmonaean family of the course (class or order) of Joiarits. (`1 Chronicles 9:10, 24:7, Nehemiah 11:10`) and continued in that line until Herod the Great destroyed that family, the last high priest, Aristobul being murdered by order of Herod (Herod the Great's brother in law) in 35 BC
