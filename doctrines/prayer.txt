Prayer
~~~~~~

1. We may know the provision of God but we must communicate with Him in order to obtain this provision.

   a. Prayer is the believer's means of communicating with God.

   #. The Bible is God's way of communicating with man.


#. Promises Involving Prayer

   a. `Matthew 21:22` We should ask believing.

   #. `Matthew 18:19` The power of corporate prayer.

   #. `Psalm 116:1, 2` God is always available to hear our prayer.

   #. `Isaiah 65:24` God will answer while we are yet praying.

   #. `Matthew 7:7` We are commanded to pray.

   #. `John 14:13-14` We can ask for anything in His name.

   #. `Philippians 4:6` The prayer should be with thanksgiving.

   #. `1 Thessalonians 5:17` We should pray without ceasing.

   #. `Hebrews 4:16` We can come boldly to the throne of Grace.


#. Prayer Divided into 4 Segments

   a. Confession of sins (`1 John 1:9`)

   #. Thanksgiving (`1 Thessalonians 5:18`)

   #. Intercession for others (`Ephesians 6:18`)

   #. Petitions for one's own needs (`Hebrews 4:16`)


#. Power of Prayer

   a. Individual - Elijah and the burnt offering (`1 Kings 18:36-39`)

   #. Corporate - the release of Peter from prison (`Acts 12:1-18`)


#. One Prayer that could not be Answered The prayer of our Lord on the Cross (`Psalm 22:1-18`)

#. To Whom are Prayers Addressed?

   a. Directed to the Father - (`Matthew 6:5-9`)

   #. In the name of the Son - (`Hebrews 7:25`)

   #. In the power of the Spirit - (`Romans 8:26-27`)


   The Son (Jesus) and Spirit are interceding for us.

#. Prayers can be Divided into Petition and Desire

   a. Petition - What you ask God for (e.g. a new car).

   #. Desire - The desire behind the petition (e.g. happiness because you have a new car).


#. Four Possible Combinations

   a. Petition answered - Desire not answered.  `Psalm 106:15` The quails of the Exodus generation.  `1 Samuel 8:5` A King to reign over Israel.

   #. Petition not answered - Desire answered. `Genesis 18:23` The preservation of Sodom.  `2 Corinthians 12:7` Removal of the thorn in Paul's side.

   #. Petition answered - Desire answered.  `1 Kings 18:36-37` Elijah requests fire for the offering.  `Luke 23:42` The penitent thief's prayer. Represents the perfect prayer.

   #. Petition not answered - Desire not answered.  Unanswered prayer has 8 main reasons which are shown in the next point.


#. Reasons for Unanswered Prayer

   a. Lack of belief (`Matthew 21:22`)

   #. Selfishness (`James 4:3`)

   #. Unconfessed sin (`Psalm 66:18`)

   #. Lack of compassion (`Proverbs 21:13`)

   #. Pride and self righteousness (`Job 35:12-13`)

   #. Lack of filling of the Spirit (`Ephesians 6:18`)

   #. Lack of obedience (`1 John 3:22`)

   #. Not in the Divine will (`1 John 5:14`)


   Most of the reasons for unanswered prayer, is some form of sin in the life, which can be solved by confession of known sins as per paragraph 3 a) under the concept of `1 John 1:9`.

   #. The power of prevailing prayer is shown in (`Acts 12`)

   #. The prayer for the unbeliever (`Romans 10:1`)

   #. Prayer for an unknown believer (`Colossians 1:3-11`)
