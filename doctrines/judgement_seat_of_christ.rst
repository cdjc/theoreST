Judgement seat of christ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. There are three types of judgement for believers in the Church Age:

   a. Judgement of Sins:- The Lord Jesus Christ on the cross substituted the payment of all man's sins. The penalty of sin is death (`Romans 6:23`). There is therefore no judgement for those in Christ Jesus (`Romans 8:1`). The substitutionary death is given in `2 Corinthians 5:19-21, Galatians 3:13`.

   #. Judgement of Self:- We are told that if we judge ourselves we shall not be judged. Failure to do so brings discipline. (`1 Corinthians 5:1-5, 11:31, 32, 2 Corinthians 2:5-7, Hebrews 12:7, 1 John 1:9`)

   #. Judgement Seat of Christ:- This is the evaluation of the production of believers for the purpose of reward (2Corinthians 5:10).


#. The Judgement Seat of Christ is a time of reward. Our human works (wood, hay, stubble) will be burned, our works in the power of the Spirit (gold, silver, precious stones) will be rewarded (`1 Corinthians 3:11-16`).

#. At the Judgement Seat of Christ the believer can be denied reward but can never lose his salvation (`2 Timothy 2:12-13`).

#. Backslidden believers have no reward at the Judgement Seat of Christ (`Hebrews 6:7-12`).

#. The Judgement Seat of Christ is illustrated by the famous athletic games in the ancient world (`1 Corinthians 9:24-27`).

#. Rewards at the Judgement Seat of Christ is based on grace (`James 2:12, 13`).

#. Since we will be judged by Christ, we are not to judge each other (`Matthew 7:1-2`).
