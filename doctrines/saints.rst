Saints
~~~~~~

1. Definition - a saint is a sanctified one - a person made holy - they are not sinless perfection or absolutely holy. They are sanctified in Christ Jesus. (`1 Corinthians 1:2`)

#. At the point of salvation a believer is sanctified positionally, (see topic sanctification) (`Hebrews 10:14`) Christians therefore, become saints at the point of salvation.

#. Our Christian walk in the power of the Spirit allows us to live "as becometh Saints." (`Romans 16:2` 1 Corinthians 1-2[TODO: what should this reference be?]) This is the fruit of the Holy Spirit. Be ye perfect as God is perfect.

#. We are called Saints of God. (`Romans 1:1-7`) not by man or because of our works. God only is able to make saints. Leaders of denominations cannot.
