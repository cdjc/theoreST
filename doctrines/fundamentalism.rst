Fundamentalism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Fundamentalism requires belief in:-

   a. The deity of Christ and the virgin birth

   #. The miracles of Christ

   #. The cross of Christ on which He paid for the sins of the world as God's efficacious substitutionary sacrifice

   #. The bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ

   #. The certainty of the yet to come Second Coming of the Lord for His church and to judge

   #. The inerrancy of the Bible as the Word of God.


#. False teachers and liberal theologians will distort all or some of these doctrines.
