Angelic conflict
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. There is a spiritual warfare between elect and fallen angels, which affects the human race (Ephesians, 6:12, `Revelation 12`).

#. Angels and mankind have a number of parallels:

   a. Angels began in innocence and full obedience to God (`Job 38:7 Ezekiel 28:14-15`)

   #. Angels sinned - rebellion of Satan (`Isaiah 14:12-14`)

   #. Angels are divided into two categories - elect or fallen


   Man began in innocence (`Genesis 2:25`)

   Man sinned - rebellion of Adam (`Genesis 3:1-7`)

   Man is divided into two categories - believers and unbelievers

#. Freewill is the key to the angelic conflict.

   a. In eternity past, Satan was called Lucifer, the most important angel. However, he became proud and rebelled against God (`Ezekiel 28:12-17, Isaiah 14:12-14`). One third of the angels chose to rebel with Satan (`Revelation 12:4,9`).

   #. In eternity past, God sentenced Satan and the fallen angels to the lake of fire (`Matthew 25:41`). This sentence will be executed at the end of human history (`Revelation 20:10`). The delay in the execution of this sentence suggests that God created the human race to provide a clear legal witness to Satan and his angels of their sin. The whole of human history is to prove certain points to the angels.

   #. It appears that God created Adam and Eve, to show Satan that mankind, created lower than angels (`Hebrews 2:6-7`), would choose to obey God. Mankind therefore, by a choice of freewill, would decide whether to obey God and be blessed, or to disobey God and be judged (the same choice that Satan had).

   #. A test was instituted for man's freewill - obedience to God or disobedience. (`Genesis 2:16-17`). Adam - and therefore all mankind - sinned and thereby rebelled against God. All of mankind, therefore, is in the same condition of sinful rebellion as Satan.

   #. However, God instituted another test of freewill for mankind - will they choose to return to God through Jesus Christ, or will they choose to continue in sin and rebellion (`John 3:16, 2 Peter 3:9`).

   #. Anyone who chooses to return to God will be saved; anyone who chooses to remain in rebellion to God will be judged in the lake of fire, the same fate as Satan (`Matthew 25:41`).

   #. Therefore, by the work of Christ on the cross, and man's freewill faith in Christ, God has vindicated His love to save and His justice to judge.


#. The result of the angelic conflict:

   a. Stage 1 - Salvation - by faith, man is saved and made positionally superior to angels (`Hebrews 2:6-7`)

   #. Stage 2 - Christian Walk - by faith, the believer overcomes Satan (`Ephesians 6:10-17`)

   #. Stage 3 - Eternity -in Christ, the believer will judge Satan and his fallen angels (`Hebrews 2:8, 1 Corinthians 6:3`).


#. Angels watch the human race (`1 Corinthians 4:9, Ephesians 3:10, 1 Timothy 5:21, 1 Peter 1:12`). Elect angels rejoice every time someone is saved (`Luke 15:10`).

#. Adam was made ruler of the world (`Genesis 1:27-28`). When he sinned, Satan obtained control of the world (`2 Corinthians 4:4, Ephesians 2:2, John 16:11`). What makes it possible for man to live in Satan's world and not be under his control? By faith and obedience to God and His Word, we can resist and overcome Satan.

#. The angelic conflict answers three basic questions:-

   a. Why did God create man? Jesus Christ, as perfect man in perfect obedience to God, paid the penalty of sin. Jesus Christ is able to save mankind. The key is freewill and obedience to God. It is a matter of freewill choice whether we are saved by God or judged by God. This shows that God's judgment of Satan is totally just.

   #. Why sin? Mankind, through the fall of Adam, was reduced to the same sinful and rebellious condition as Satan and his fallen angels. However, through Jesus Christ, man is able to choose to return to God.

   #. Why does God allow suffering? Suffering, sickness and death is the result of Adam's sin. However, God still uses this for our good because suffering makes people look in faith toward God. God is therefore able to strengthen our faith (`1 Peter 5:6-10`).


#. Satanic attack:-

   a. In the Garden of Eden, Satan attacked Adam and Eve, resulting in their sin. Satan thought he had destroyed the plan of God, because man had sinned and rebelled against God. However, God promised to send the Messiah to remove sin and defeat Satan (`Genesis 3:15`).

   #. In the Old Testament, Satan attacked the Jews and Jesus Christ Himself. Satan wanted to prevent and/or destroy the Messiah (`Revelation 12:1-5`).

   #. Now that Jesus Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father, Satan has turned his attack on believers on earth. Satan wants to thwart and/or delay the plan of God, and his own final judgment (`Revelation 12:12,17`).
