Church discipline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Those who will not heed the Word of God within the church are to be first warned and then rebuked (privately if the error is private, or publically if their error is public) (`2 Thessalonians 3:14, Titus 1:13, 14`).

#. If they still will not listen to the truth then the individuals are to be isolated from the fellowship and others are to separate themselves from them (`1 Timothy 6:3-5`).

#. If they still refuse to change they are to be expelled from the fellowship (`Titus 3:10, Galatians 1:6-10`).

#. Paul warns about false doctrine (`1 Timothy 1:4, 11`). Then he expels the two false teachers, Hymeneus, and Alexander, that they might learn the truth and stop blaspheming (`1 Timothy 1:18-20`).

#. Any expulsion is only temporary, it applies only so long as the person is unrepentant. When they repent they are to be received back again as was the prodigal son (`Luke 15:11-32`), and the man in adultery (`1 Corinthians 5:1-13, 2 Corinthians 2:5-11`).
