Mystery of iniquity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. General Scripture:  (`2 Thessalonians 2`).

#. The mystery of iniquity is the inherent evil which is personified in the lawless one . This system is being restrained by the Holy Spirit at the moment.

#. The mystery of iniquity was already at work at the time of writing of the epistle in 54 AD. (v 7)

#. There is going to be major apostasy in the professing church. This is pictured in the lukewarm church of Laodicea in (v 3 cf. `Revelation 3:14-22`)

#. At some time in the future the restrainer is removed so that the mystery of iniquity can fully develop. (v 6-7)

#. It is noted that the restrainer is a person. The restrainer is the Holy Spirit. Because the Holy Spirit indwells all believers in this present age, when He is taken out of the way all believers will also be taken out of the way. This will occur at the Rapture of the Church. (v 7 cf. `John 14:16-17, 1 Thessalonians 4:14-17`)

#. The manifestation of the lawless one, the Antichrist, will then occur. (v 8-10)

#. The coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the destruction of the lawless one and his dispatch to the Lake of Fire. (v8)

#. The day of the Lord. (v 9-12)
