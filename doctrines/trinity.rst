Trinity
~~~~~~~

1. There is one God.  He has manifest Himself in three personalities. (`2 Samuel 23:1-3, Isaiah 48:16, Isaiah 63:7-10, Matthew 28:19, Acts 2:33, 2 Corinthians 13:14`)

#. The oneness of God refers to the unity or sameness of character.  All three members of the Trinity are equal (`Philippians 2:6, Deuteronomy 6:4, Acts 17:29, Romans 1:20, Colossians 2:9`), although they have different functions/purposes in relation to man.

#. The three members are distinguished according to their function in the plan of salvation (`1 Peter 1:2-3`)

   a. The Father - the authority, who planned our salvation (`Isaiah 14:27, John 4:34, 5:17, 12:44, 1 Corinthians 8:6a, Ephesians 3:11`)

   #. The Son - the obedient son, who was born as a man, died for our sins, and rose from the dead  (`John 4:34, 5:17, Hebrews 10:7`)

   #. The Holy Spirit - the ministering servant, who reveals the Son and sanctifies us  (`John 16:8-11`).


#. The Son is the only visible member of the Trinity (`John 1:18, 6:46, 1 Timothy 6:16, 1 John 4:12`).  He was revealed in the Old Testament in Christophonies (e.g. the Angel of Jehovah) and became flesh in the New Testament (`Exodus 3:14` cf. `John 8:58; Psalm 10:16` cf. `Revelation 11:15; Zechariah 14` cf. `Revelation 19`).

#. Evidences of the Trinity:

   a. Affirmed by the use of the title Elohim (plural, Gods) in the Old Testament and the plural pronoun "us" in (`Genesis 1:26, 3:22, 11:7`).

   #. The worship of God we have repeated three times "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty” (`Isaiah 6:3, Revelation 4`).

   #. The name (singular) of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit indicates Trinity (`Matthew 28:19-20`).

   #. The Lord's Baptism - the Spirit descends, the Father speaks from heaven and the Son is baptised (`Matthew 3`).


#. Light is a good illustration of the Trinity (`1 John 1:5`).  Light is one, but has three elements:

   a. Father - actinic light - that part of light which is invisible, nor felt.

   #. Son - luminiferous - that part of light which is both seen and felt.

   #. Spirit - calorific - that part of light which is not seen but felt.

    No. This is pseudo-scientific nonsense. Remove. Every analogy of the trinity will have some deficiency in representing the trinity, but the analogy itself should at least make sense. I would bet there's not a physicist alive who thinks this one makes sense.
