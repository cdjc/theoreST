Salvation
~~~~~~~~~

1. Salvation is the gift of God by grace through faith.

#. We cannot work for salvation - we must receive it as a gift. (`Ephesians 2:8, 9, Romans 4:4-5`)

#. The only means of salvation is by trusting that Jesus Christ died for your sins, was buried and raised from the dead. He therefore paid the penalty for sin, and conquered death. (`Acts 16:30-31, John 3:16, 14:6, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4`)

#. We are saved so that we can serve God. (`Ephesians 2:8-10`) Our good works show that we have been saved.

#. Salvation includes many other doctrines such as Imputation, Justification, Redemption, Propitiation, Reconciliation and Sanctification.
