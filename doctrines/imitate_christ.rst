Imitate christ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Imitation is the foundation of discipleship, the surest and quickest method of training (`1 Corinthians 4:16`).

#. The Corinthians could imitate Paul, for he was imitating Jesus Christ. In context the imitation has to do with self sacrifice for the cause of the ministry (`1 Corinthians 10`; 23-33, 11:1).

#. As the believer imitates Christ he reflects the character of the invisible God. Here the imitation relates specifically to God's love expressed in forgiveness. (`Ephesians 4:32, 5:1-2`)

#. Peter illustrates the fact that the minister of God's Word is to be an example to those he teaches (`1 Peter 5:2-3`).

#. To become an example you first must be an imitator (`1 Thessalonians 1:6-7`).

#. Imitation is the primary teaching method of Jesus Christ (`1 Peter 2:21`).

#. The call of "follow me" was used by ancient rabbis to call their disciples to a life of learning by imitation (`Matthew 4:19, John 21:19,22`).

#. The principle of imitation is conformity (`Matthew 10:24-25; Luke 6:40`).

#. This principle was fulfilled when the training of the disciples was finally completed (`Acts 4:13`).

#. The quest of the pastor teacher must be to imitate Christ and to be imitated in the faith (`Hebrews 13:7`).
