Sanctification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Sanctification means to be made holy - to be set apart unto God. One who is sanctified is called a saint.

#. We are sanctified (made holy) in Christ Jesus (`1 Corinthians 1:2`).

#. Sanctification is in three stages:

   a. Stage 1: At salvation - union with Christ - positional sanctification (`1 Corinthians 12:13, Romans 1:1-7`).

   #. Stage 2: Christian way of life - filling of the Holy Spirit - spirituality (`Romans 16:2; 1 Corinthians 1:2`).

   #. Stage 3: Resurrection body - In heaven - Ultimate sanctification (`1 John 3:2`).


#. Our position in Christ entitles us to share Christ's righteousness. It therefore:

   a. protects us from divine judgment (`Romans 8:1`)

   #. qualifies us to live with God forever

   #. makes us a new creature in Christ (`2 Corinthians 5:17`)

   #. guarantees eternal security for every believer (`Romans 8:38, 39`).


#. However, because we still have the old sin nature, we will still sin during this life (`Romans 7:21`). When controlled by his carnal nature however, the believer is positionally sanctified but experientially carnal.

#. When we receive the resurrection body, we no longer sin - our sanctification will be complete (`1 Corinthians 15:56, Philippians 3:21, 1 Thessalonians 5:23`).
