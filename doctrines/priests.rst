Priests
~~~~~~~

1. A priest is a man who represents himself or other men before God.

#. There are three categories of priesthood in human history:

   a. Family priest - from Adam until Levi

   #. Levitical priesthood. - appointed under the Law of Moses

   #. Royal priesthood

      i. Melchizedek - king of Jerusalem, but also priest of the Most High (`Genesis 14:18`)

      #. Jesus Christ - King of Kings and the Great High Priest (`Hebrews 10:17`)

      #. Church Age believer - we share Christ's priesthood, since we are united with Him (`1 Peter 2:9`)



#. Until the Law was given the head of each family was the priest for that family. (`Genesis 8:20, 26:25, 31:54`)

#. When the Law was proposed the whole nation of Israel was to be "a kingdom of priests unto God". The nation of Israel however failed in unbelief.

#. God appointed Aaron and his family in the tribe of Levi as a specialised priesthood (`Exodus 28:1`)

#. All believers in the Church Age have become a kingdom of priests in Christ (`1 Peter 2:9, Revelation 1:6`)

#. The chief privilege of being a priest is to be able to approach God directly. (`Hebrews 4:14-16, 10:19-22`)

#. In their role as a priest the believer offers:-

   a. Their own body. (`Romans 12:1, Philippians 2:17`)

   #. Praise to God. (`Hebrews 13:15-16`)

   #. Their possessions. (`Romans 12:13, Galatians 6:6`)

   #. Intercession on behalf of others. (`Colossians 4:12,1 Timothy 2:1`)


#. The priest must be a partaker of the nature of the people he represents. Jesus Christ had to be a human too. (`Hebrews 5:1, 7:4, 5, 7:14-28, 10:5, 10:10-14`)

#. Comparison of the priesthoods

      #. The priests came from the tribe of Levi. The kings came from the tribe of Judah. No person could be a priest and a king.

      #. Was based on mere men, with their own weaknesses and sin

      #. Ended when the priest died


   #. The Royal Priesthood of Christ

      i. Is based on Christ's sacrifice, which took away all sin for all time

      #. Is based on spiritual birth, being born again into the family of God

      #. Is universal to all believers in the Church Age

      #. It is a royal priesthood - because of the Kingship and Priestly office of Jesus Christ
