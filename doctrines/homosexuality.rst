Homosexuality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The Bible tells us that homosexuality is not a form of immaturity; an aspect of normal human development; the product of certain kinds of experience or the result of genetic factors. It is a learned activity.

#. It is not a condition or sickness; it is an act of sin (`Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Deuteronomy 23:17; 1 Timothy 1:10; 1`Corinthians 6:9; `Revelation 22:15`).

#. It is the culminating sexual practice of a culminating apostasy and hostility towards God. It is an act against God and therefore against nature (`Romans 1:21-30`). The "burned out" product of rebellion (verse 27).

#. In the Bible, homosexuals are called "dogs" - a "despised" sin and practice (`Deuteronomy 23:18; Revelation 22:15`).

#. It was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah, hence the word 'sodomy' (`Genesis 19:5`).

#. Being the product of rebellion and apostasy, it is nor surprising that we see this activity (together with prostitution) as a religious practice in pagan worship in Canaan.

#. God's patience allowed them four generations, from Abraham to Joshua before judgment (`Genesis 15:16; Leviticus 18:24-28`).

#. The failure of Israel to execute God's judgment fully became their own judgment (`Judges 2:2,3; 19:22,25; Leviticus 18:28; 1 Kings 14:24; 15:12; 2 Kings 23:7`).

#. By calling homosexuality a disease or an inherited genetic defect, we deprive the homosexual of all hope. It is a sin that can be forgiven in Christ, and through the working of the Holy Spirit the old, sinful way of life can be abandoned and a new one established (`Isaiah 1:18; 1 John 1:7; 1 Corinthians 6:9,11`).

   God's answer to sexual immorality is in (`1 Corinthians 7:1-9`).
