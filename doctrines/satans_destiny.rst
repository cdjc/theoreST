Satan's destiny
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Satan is called a "prince" indicating that he had his own power and followers (`John 12:31, 14:30, 16:11, Ephesians 2:2, 2 Corinthians 4:4`).

#. Yet he is still a creature, and is still ultimately subject to God (`Job 1:12`).

#. At the cross, Christ defeated Satan, as his main power was through sin and death (`John 12:27-32, Romans 5:12, 1 Corinthians 15:54-56, Colossians 2:14-15, Hebrews 2:14-15`).

#. God purpose with the world is not yet complete - therefore the enforcement of Satan's defeat will not take place until the end of the Millennium (`Hebrews 1:13, Revelation 20:10`).

#. Satan's final judgment is sure:-

   a. When he fell, he was condemned. This was before `Genesis 1:2`.

   #. In the garden the certainty of God's judgment was announced (`Genesis 3:15`).

   #. The Cross was his final defeat (`John 12:31, Colossians 2:14-15`).

   #. In the midst of the Great Tribulation his access to heaven will be stopped. He will no longer be able to slander believers. (`Revelation 12:7-12`)

   #. At the Second Advent he is arrested and bound (`Revelation 20:1-3`).

   #. After the Millennium he is briefly released to lead the last great rebellion against God, and is finally cast into the Lake of Fire (`Revelation 20:10`).

   #. There are therefore four falls of Satan:-

      i. from his place in eternity past to the earth with access to heaven

      #. then that access is denied causing him to be restricted to the Earth

      #. he is then contained in Hades for a thousand years

      #. then his final fall into the Lake of Fire.



#. Satan has six abodes in his journey from the throne room of God to the Lake of Fire:

   a. The Throne of God (`Ezekiel 28:12`)

   #. The Mineral Garden of Eden (`Ezekiel 28:13`)

   #. The Atmospheric Heavens (`Ephesians 2:2, 6:12`)

   #. The Earth (`Revelation 12:7-12`)

   #. The Abyss (`Revelation 20:1-3`)

   #. The Lake of Fire (`Revelation 20:7-10`).
