Cain and abel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Salvation and Worship in Pre Flood Time

   The only way to have a relationship with God in early times is the same as we have today - the blood of Christ - they looked forward to the Cross, we look back historically. (`Hebrews 9:22, Ephesians 1:7, 1 Peter 1:18,19`)

   The way of Cain: The way of Cain is false religion - no blood - no regeneration - no salvation - the way of good works - good deeds.

   The Family: The family was set up in the beginning to teach what is wrong, what is right, and how to approach God. Adam and Eve, who were born again, would have taught their children about spiritual things.

#. WORSHIP

   a. Where to worship:

   #. When to Worship:

   #. Means of Worship:


   In (`Genesis 4:3`) and (4:16) they were taught that there was a place to worship - they both brought their offering to a specific place. Evaluation of (`Genesis 3:24`) would appear to show that the place of worship was at the entrance to the garden of Eden which was guarded by the cherubim. Abel came with the blood of the animal. Cain approached with produce - his own good works.

   In (`Genesis 4:3`) we read "in the process of time " which means at the proper time or at the end of a specified number of days. It could have been the Sabbath, it could have been Sunday.

   In (`Genesis 4:4`) Abel brought a lamb, sacrificed it, and God was satisfied.

#. Cain and Abel

   a. Cain - means ‘acquired’. Eve was a little confused when she named her sons. Eve knew there were two lines - the line of the fig leaves - the line of the skins, the seed of Satan and the seed of woman. She thought Cain was the seed of the woman. He was however the first of the seed of Satan.

   #. Abel - means 'nothingness' - he was orientated to grace and first in line of regeneration.

   #. Occupations: Cain was a farmer whereas Abel was a shepherd. (`John 1:29` cf. `Genesis 3:21`)


#. Cain's Offering

   a. Type

      i. it was bloodless (`Hebrews 9:22`)

      #. in the sweat of thy brow - it was a result of Cain's own hard work - human good. (`Isaiah 64:6`)

      #. it was cursed (`Genesis 3:17`)

      #. not acceptable to God (`Titus 3:5`).


   #. Implications

      i. Cain failed to recognise sin and the penalty of sin and his own need.

      #. He denied the curse of man.

      #. Cain refused God's offer for help.

      #. Cain's attitude - I have done this. Self righteousness.

      #. Cain wanted a cover not a cure. (`Matthew 23:27,28`)


   #. Religion ignores the blood of Christ, it is characterized by good deeds.


   Cain was an excellent farmer who brought the best vegetables and fruit from the ground.

#. Abel's Offering - `Genesis 4:4`

   Abel was a shepherd and brought of the firstlings of the flock and fat thereof. (`Hebrews 11:4, 1 John 3:12`)

   Grace Principle - the approach through the blood of an innocent victim. It wasn't that Abel had a nice personality or Cain a bad personality, the principle is divine truth. The blood versus no blood. Divine works versus human works.

#. Verse 5 - God deals with Cain:

   Human rejection of divine salvation means divine rejection of that individual. Cain's reaction - he was very angry to the point of a tantrum and his face fell. Abel was accepted. Cain became jealous of Abel and lusted for precedence in the second generation.

#. Verses 6-7 - God puts the alternative to Cain:

   God asked why are you angry and look sad. "If you do well" (totally good) believe in Christ "shalt thou not be accepted", if not (human good) "the sin offering (Jesus Christ) lieth at the door. (Salvation is still available while the door remains open - `Revelation 3:20`. It is God's will that you be saved - `2 Peter 3:9`) " thou shalt rule over him " - Cain was the first-born and had certain rights:- a) rulership; b) priesthood; c) double portion.

   Cain is about to be disinherited because he is not acceptable to God. He again rejects God's approach, his jealousy turns to hatred and hatred to murder.

#. Cain and Abel stand as representatives of the human race. Cain the unbeliever, Abel the believer. (`John 3:36`)
