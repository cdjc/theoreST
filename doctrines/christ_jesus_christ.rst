1. SCRIPTURE - He is the Word `John 1:1-5,14`

#. BIOGRAPHY

   As God, Jesus Christ has existed eternally with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit (`John 1:1-5`). As the God-man, Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit (`Matthew 1:20`), born of a Jewish virgin, Mary (`Matthew 1:18`) in Bethlehem of Judea in 6 BC. His legal father was Joseph. Both Joseph (`Matthew 1:16`) and Mary (`Luke 3:23`), were descended from David, through Solomon and Nathan. Circumcised on the eighth day (`Luke 2:21-24`). He grew in knowledge and grace. He was baptised by his kinsman, John the Baptist, in the Jordan (`Matthew 3:13-17`) at the commencement of His ministry, and then went into the desert to be tempted by the devil for 40 days and nights (`Matthew 4:1-11`). Jesus spent the next three years in a ministry ranging throughout Palestine, healing the sick, preaching, teaching and encouraging those to whom He ministered that they turn to God. Betrayed by one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, He suffered six trials before Jewish and Roman dignitaries before being condemned to death. He died on the cross on the Passover in AD 32, completing His perfect ministry and life on earth, and securing salvation. God raised Jesus from the dead on the feast of first fruits three days later. He ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives ten days before Pentecost (`Acts 1:8-11`). In heaven He was given the place of commendation at the right hand of the Father, where He makes intercession for us and waits for His enemies to be made His footstool. Jesus Christ will return with His saints to reign for 1000 years (`Revelation 20:1-6`) and will judge unbelievers at the last judgment (`Revelation 20:11-15`). Believers will spend eternity with Jesus Christ.
