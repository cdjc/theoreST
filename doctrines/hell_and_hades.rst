Hell and hades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. HELL is from the Greek GEHENNA. This was a place where children were burned as offerings to Molech. (`2 Chronicles 33:6, Jeremiah 7:31`). Molech was a huge idol with outstretched paws on which the children were tied prior to being burnt to death.

#. HELL is the same as the Lake of Fire where the lost spend eternity. (`Revelation 19:20, 20:10`)

#. Hades (Gk) in the New Testament is often translated HELL. SHEOL (Hb) is the Old Testament equivalent. Hades and Sheol are in the centre of the earth, cf. Saul, Samuel (from Paradise or Abraham's Bosom) and the Witch of Endor. (`1 Samuel 28:7-19`) Hades or Sheol is the place of the souls and spirits of people who died while awaiting the resurrection. Hades is also the place of imprisonment of a certain group of angels - TARTARUS.

#. HADES is divided into three sections, one section being divided from the other two by a "Great Gulf' Fixed". (`Luke 16:19-31`)

   a. Abraham's Bosom or Paradise - The abode of the saved until the ascension of Jesus Christ. The Lord said to the repentant thief - "This day shall thou be with me in Paradise. (`Luke 23:43`)

   #. Torments - The abode of the unsaved, reserved until the last judgment at the end of the millennium. This is a place of great sorrow and suffering. (`Revelation 20:13`)

   #. Tartarus - The prison of fallen angels who kept not their first estate. These are fallen angels from `Genesis 6`. This is a place of imprisonment (`2 Peter 2:4`)


   It should be noted that the story of Lazarus is a true story, and not a parable, because it mentions proper names (Lazarus) and a geographical location - Hades.)

#. Since the ascension of Christ - Paradise has been empty, with the saved being transferred to the Third Heaven. (`2 Corinthians 12:1-4, Ephesians 4:7-10`)

#. Those who die now as believers go directly to the Third Heaven ("at home with the Lord"), with soul and spirit but no resurrection body. (`2 Corinthians 5:8`)

#. Those in Hades (Torments) will be brought before the Great White Throne after which they will be thrown into the Lake of Fire. (`Revelation 20:13-15`). This is the Last Judgment.

#. Hades is in the heart of the earth. (`Matthew 12:40; 1 Samuel 28:7-15`)

#. There are no degrees of punishment in the Lake of Fire.

   a. Degrees of punishment tend to deny the literal lake of fire. Nothing to indicate the temperature of the lake of fire is not constant.

   #. Degrees of punishment is contrary to the doctrine of unlimited atonement. Christ died for every sin that has ever been committed. Man is not judged on the basis of his sins but human good. (`Revelation 20:11-15`)

   #. Degrees of punishment destroys the principle of salvation. Its concept is that one rejecter of grace gets less fire than another rejecter of grace. The unsaved are unsaved because they reject grace.

   #. Degrees of punishment is based on the theory that for a thesis there is an antithesis and when they come together you have synthesis (the Hegelian fallacy).

   #. False concept:- One person commits a bad sin, one person performs a marvellous good work. Obviously there must be different degrees of punishment in eternity.
