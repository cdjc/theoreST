Election and predestination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The Biblical concept of predestination does not conflict with human freewill.

#. Christ was predestined for a specific purpose from eternity past - to go to the cross and be raised to glory (`Isaiah 42:1, 1 Peter 2:4-6, Acts 2:23`).

#. All members of the human race are potentially elect by the Father under the concept of unlimited atonement (`2 Peter 3:9, 1 John 2:2`).

#. When a person trusts in Christ for salvation, he is united with Christ and therefore shares His election and destiny (`1 Corinthians 1:2, 30, Romans 8:28, 32, Ephesians 1:4`).

#. Election is closely linked with foreknowledge. In eternity past, God knew who would believe, He therefore predestined them, called them, and they were saved (`Romans 8:29-30, 2 Timothy 1:9`).

#. Therefore, election and predestination applies to the believer only. No person is predestined for hell - it is a choice of freewill (`John 3:18, John 3:36`).

#. Election is a present and future possession of every believer (`John 15:16, Colossians 3:12`).

#. Election is also the foundation of the universal church (`1 Thessalonians 1:4`).

#. There are five Greek words used in conjunction with predestination:

   a. Pro Orizo - to predesign (`Romans 8:28, 29, Ephesians 1:5, 11`)

   #. Protithemi - to predetermine (`Romans 3:25, Ephesians 1:9`)

   #. Prothesis - a predetermined plan (`Romans 8:28, 9:11, Ephesians 1:11, 3:11, 2 Timothy 1:9`)

   #. Proginosko - to foreordain, to preordain. (`Romans 8:29, 11:2, 1 Peter 1:20`)

   #. Prognosis - foreknowledge or predetermined purpose (`Acts 2:23, 1 Peter 1:2`).


#. The life of Judas is a good illustration of predestination and freewill:

   a. God's call is to all people, His desire is that all will be saved. (`Matthew 28:18-20, John 3:16, 1 John 2:2, 3:23`)

   #. God is long suffering towards the lost, not willing that any should perish. (`2 Peter 3:9`)

   #. God's call is to all, but people must respond. (`John 3:36, 16:8-11`)

   #. God's call is of love. (`Jeremiah 31:3, John 3:16`)

   #. Those who resist become hardened in their souls and open to Satanic influence or possession. (`Romans 1:20-32, 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12`)

   #. Judas was chosen in love by the Lord (`Matthew 10:1-4, John 13:18`) and received the sop of the honoured guest and sat at the Lord's right hand at supper.

   #. However Judas was a thief and a traitor. (`John 12:6, 13:18`)

   #. As an unsaved man he was involved in evangelism. Others were probably saved through his reading of the word but he was not. (`Matthew 10:1-8`)

   #. He became the Son of Perdition by his decision, he could not blame anyone else (`John 17:12`)
