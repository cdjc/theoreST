Satanâ€™s strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Believers are warned against him and his tactics (`Ephesians 4:27, 6:11-13, James 4:7, 1 Peter 5:8`).

#. We must be ready and alert (`2 Corinthians 2:11`).

#. Satan is a deceiver and a counterfeiter. He uses deception - not obviously wrong or sinful - but very subtle changes to the truth (`Genesis 3:1`). Remember, a counterfeit looks like the original.

#. Satan is described as an "angel of light" - often seeming attractive and "good" (`2 Corinthians 11:14`).

#. His tactics:

   a. Towards unbelievers:

      i. to blind them regarding the gospel (2Corinthians 4:3, 4, 2Thessalonians 2:9, 10).


   #. Towards believers:

      i. Satan seeks to hinder our growth and witness (`1 Peter 5:8`).

      #. Satan will mislead into false doctrine and legalism (1Timothy 5:14-15).

      #. He persuades believers to ignore the will of God through disobedience (`Genesis 2:17, James 4:7-8`).

      #. Satan often attacks our assurance of salvation so that we doubt God.

      #. Worry (`1 Peter 5`, 7-9).

      #. Fear of death (`Hebrews 2:14-15`).

      #. He accuses believers of sin both to God and to the believer (using guilt) (`Revelation 12:9-10, Job 1:6-11`).

      #. He takes our focus off Christ by getting eyes on self (1Corinthians 1:10-11), on people (1Corinthians 1:12), on things (`Hebrews 13:5-6`).

      #. When we don't allow the Holy Spirit to control our lives, we open ourselves up to Satanic attack (1Corinthians 7:5, `2 Corinthians 2:11, 1`Timothy 5:14-15).

      #. The Lord will allow Satan to attack a believer as discipline for unconfessed sin (1Timothy 1:20 cf. 2Corinthians 12:7).

      #. Satan cannot indwell or possess a believer, only beguile them (`Galatians 3:1`).


   #. Towards the world in general:

      i. The World - Satan tries to deceive the nations (`Revelation 20:7-10`).
