Sin unto death
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. There is a sin unto death (`1 John 5:16, 17, 1 Corinthians 11:31,32`)

#. The sin unto death is the physical death of a believer, where ultimate discipline is administered to the Christian due to unconfessed sin of a serious nature.

#. Confession of sin under the concept of I `John 1:9` is the way to forgiveness.

#. Examples of sin unto death:-

   a. The Corinthians who habitually came to the Lord's table in an unworthy manner (`1 Corinthians 11:27-32`)

   #. Moses (`Deuteronomy 32:48-52`)

   #. Achan (`Joshua 7:16-26`)

   #. Ananias and Sapphira (`Acts 5: 1-11`).


   a)The Corinthian Pervert (`1 Corinthians 5`)

#. Whilst there is a sin unto death there is no condemnation to them in Christ Jesus - all believers (`Romans 8: 1`).

#. The effect of the sin unto death is to reduce the time which a believer can spend on earth accumulating good of eternal worth. The gold, silver and precious stones of 1Corinthians 3:11-15.
