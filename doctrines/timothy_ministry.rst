Timothy – Ministry 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. SCRIPTURE -         Acts 16-20,[TODO: chapter range reference] 1 Timothy; 2 Timothy; [TODO: book reference] `Hebrews 13:23`.

#. BIOGRAPHY

   Timothy's father was an unnamed Greek, whilst his mother was a devout Jewish Christian named Eunice (`Acts 16:1`).  His grandmother was Lois (`2 Timothy 1:5`).  Timothy was instructed in the Old Testament scriptures by Eunice and Lois (`2 Timothy 3:14`).  As a young man he joined Paul (`1 Timothy 4:12`), presumably meeting him on his first missionary journey (`Acts 14`).  Timothy appears to have been a native of Lystra.  His first definitive reference in the scriptures is at the beginning of Paul's second missionary journey (`Acts 16:1-3`).  For a while Timothy teamed up with Silas when they stayed in Berea (`Acts 17:15`) before rejoining Paul at Corinth (`Acts 18:5`).

   On his third journey Paul stayed for an extended period in Ephesus.  From this city Paul sent Timothy to Corinth to try and solve problems in that church (`1 Corinthians 4:17; 16:10`).  He was not successful.  When Paul wrote Romans from Corinth, Timothy was shown to be a fellow worker (`Romans 16:21`).  Timothy accompanied Paul on his last journey to Jerusalem (`Acts 20:4`).  Paul wrote two letters to Timothy, which were included in the canon of scripture.  These were sent to Timothy at Ephesus.  In the last reference to Timothy (`Hebrews 13:23`), it is apparent that he had recently been released from prison.

#. EVALUATION

   a. A minister should not forbid to marry or commend to be a vegetarian (`1 Timothy 4:3`).

   #. He should be nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine (`1 Timothy 4:6`).

   #. Pursuit of godliness produces benefit for ministers (`1 Timothy 4:7,8`).

   #. The minister should be an example to other believers:

      i. in word

      #. in conversation

      #. in love

      #. in spirit

      #. in faith

      #. in purity (`1 Timothy 4:12`).


   #. The minister should concentrate on reading, meditation, exhortation and doctrine (`1 Timothy 4:13,15`).

   #. Being faithful to the doctrine will make the minister effective (`1 Timothy 4:16`).

   #. Great blessing is obtained from godliness with contentment (`1 Timothy 6:6; 1 Thessalonians 5:18`).

   #. The minister should pursue:  i) righteousness; ii) godliness; iii) faith; iv) love; v) patience; vi) meekness (`1 Timothy 6:11; Galatians 5:22,23`).

   #. Ministers are to fight the good faith and be a leader and good example to other Christians (`1 Timothy 6:12`).

   #. The minister should emphasise to the materially rich that they should not trust in their riches, but in God, the source of spiritual richness (`1 Timothy 6:17-19`).

   This should be consistent with the 'Minister' doctrine.


#. PRINCIPLES

   a. The Holy Spirit gives to believers various spiritual gifts (`Romans 12:6`).

   #. To some He will give the gift of ministry or pastor/teacher (`Romans 12:7; Ephesians 4:11`).

   #. Christian relatives, especially parents, have tremendous responsibilities and opportunities in guiding children to the Lord (`Psalm 78:3,4`).

   #. The Lord will provide opportunities for the believer to grow (e.g. Timothy's relation to Paul) (`Ephesians 4:15; 1` Peter 2:2).

   #. The minister should be controlled by the Spirit and be a faithful shepherd to his flock (`1 Peter 5:2,3`).

   #. Knowledge of doctrine and its application to the life of the church is a prime responsibility of a minister (`Titus 2:1,7`).

   #. The Lord honours faithfulness in spiritual matters (`Matthew 25:21,23`).
