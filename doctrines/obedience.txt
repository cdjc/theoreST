Obedience
~~~~~~~~~

1. Obedience is better than offerings (`1 Samuel 15:22; Proverbs 21:3; 28:9`). If we are not in God's will, any "worship" we offer is unacceptable.

#. Obedience is something you have to learn. The basic training in obedience has to start in childhood. As it says in (`Exodus 20:12` and `Deuteronomy 5:16`) "Honour your father and your mother. " (`Proverbs 4:3,4; 22:6; 29:15-17; Hebrews 5:8`)

#. Teaching your child obedience is an act of love (`Proverbs 3:12; 19:18; 23:13-14`).

#. We have to obey those who are in authority over us (`Exodus 20:12; 22:28; Leviticus 19:3; Deuteronomy 5:16; Romans 13:1-5; Ephesians 6:1-5; Colossians 3:18-22; Titus 3:1`).

#. Those in authority have been put in that position by God (`Romans 13:1`).

#. Obedience to those in authority is obedience to God (`Proverbs 24:21; Ephesians 6:7; Colossians 3:23-24; Romans 13:5`).

#. Disobedience to those in authority is disobedience to God (`Romans 1:30; 13:2`).

#. But when we are ordered to do something that is against God's Will we have to disobey (`Acts 4:19; 5:40-42`).

#. The fifth commandment (`Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16`) is the only commandment with a promise (`Proverbs 10:17; Ephesians 6:1-3`). Social life in a society is only possible when the people in it have learned to obey.

#. If this commandment is ignored, if the authority of the family is denied or not exercised, society will quickly slide into anarchy (`Isaiah 3:12; Proverbs 29:21; 30:21-23; Romans 1:30`).

#. Jesus Christ was perfect in His obedience (`Luke 2:51; Philippians 2:8`). Examples of the Lord's perfect obedience to the Father's will:

   a. The Lord's temptation in the wilderness (`Matthew 4:1-11`), where the Lord resisted the temptation in His humanity to use His divine power outside the Father's will (`Philippians 2:5-8, Hebrews 10:7`)

   #. In the Garden of Gethsemane the Lord resisted all temptation to the contrary but set His face firmly to go through with the horror of the cross (`Matthew 26:38-46, Mark 14:34-42, Luke 22:41-44`)

   #. During the provocations of the trials the Lord stood firm and resolute. Although He had the power to resist arrest, as shown briefly in (`John 18:6`), He voluntarily went with the troops, even chiding Peter for his sword play (`Luke 22:49-51`). Although abused (`Matthew 26:67-68`), struck (`John 18:22`), scourged (`Matthew 27:26`), mocked and beaten (`Matthew 27:27-31`), and finally crucified the Lord calmly accepted this all as part of the Father's Plan, resisting any temptation to rebel at the injustice, cruelty and callousness of those who perpetrated this evil. Rather He prayed for them, acknowledging to Pilate that all this was part of His role as Saviour (`Luke 23:34, John 18:37`)

   #. When miracles were demanded by Herod Antipas (`Luke 23:8-11`) the Lord resisted any temptation to instantly judge that evil man and his court but saying nothing set His face to the cross on which He would bear even the sins of Herod Antipas (`1 John 2:2`)

   #. When He stumbled on the road to the cross He did not call on divine strength but Simon of Cyrene had to be pressed into service to carry the cross (`Matthew 27:32, Luke 23:26`)

   #. When reviled by the crowds as He hung on the cross, taunted to do things which He could have done, He resisted all temptation to step down from the cross but stayed there to bear the sins of all (`Matthew 27:39-44, Mark 15:29-32, Luke 23:35-39`).
