Apostasy
~~~~~~~~

1. Apostasy means falling away.

#. Apostasy differs from backsliding. A true Christian can backslide, an apostate is never born again, eg. Judas Iscariot.

#. The backslidden Christian breaks fellowship, but doesn't lose his salvation (`John 5:24`).

#. The apostate is declared in (`2 Timothy 4:3-4`) and (`1 John 2:19`).

#. Apostates may do good works calling themselves Christians but they should not be accepted as such (`2 John 9`-11, `John 10:12-13`).

#. There will be a great apostasy prior to the Rapture (`2 Thessalonians 2:3`).
