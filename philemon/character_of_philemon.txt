The Character of Philemon
-------------------------

.. biblepassage:: Philemon 1:4-7

Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*verse 4* Philemon is mature. He owns slaves and is a mature believer. Paul is thankful for him. There are many believers whom Paul is not thankful for.

“Thank” is the present active indicative of Eucharisteo, Present tense means that it is a constant thing, active voice Paul does it with the indicative showing the reality of the thankfulness

Out of respect comes love. Paul thanks “my God” which is the dative singular with the definite article is used for a personal pronoun. This is better translated I thank our God. 

Making mention of you at the time of my prayers is the present middle participle of Poieo. The present tense is a descriptive present. He is praying for him still. 

Mention is the accusative singular direct object of Mneia which means remembering those who you love.

Pantote translated always means that he does this at any time he prays. We are told to pray without ceasing but this really means to pray with the frequency of a hacking cough.

Epi and Proseuche means ‘at the time of my prayers’ not ‘in my prayers’ which would be the word En rather than Epi.

Translation v 4  – I keep thanking our God at all times making mention of you at the time of my prayers.

*verse 5* In verse 5 we have the love and faith which Philemon has towards two objects, the Lord Jesus Christ and towards the saints.

This is Pros plus the accusative which means face to face with the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Towards all saints is the word Eis plus the accusative of Hagios. The object of his love in this case are other believers.

*verse 6* Philemon is told in this letter that he is not facing a run away slave but a mature believer now. How is he going to handle this new situation?

“That” is the conjunction Hopos which should be translated ‘in order that’

Communication is the word Koinonia which means fellowship. This phrase – that our communication should be translated ‘in order that our association’

The word Pistis deals with the doctrine which Philemon knows and is able to work on as a mature Christian.

“May become” is the middle active subjunctive of Ginomai which means to become something that you were not before.

Become effectual is Energes means to be operational.

By the acknowledging is En plus the instrumental of Epignosis.

Of every good thing is Pas Agathos which means of all the intrinsic good which is in you.

‘In Christ Jesus’ should be translated ‘towards Christ Jesus’

Translation – In order that our association with reference to the doctrine that you have in you may become operational towards Christ by means of epignosis of all the intrinsic good in you.

*verse 7* Philemon has doctrine in his soul. The word ‘for we have ’ is Gar plus the singular ingressive aorist of Echo which means ‘for I have come to have’. Epaphras the pastor of the church has brought information about Philemon and that has given great blessing to Paul.

Great is the accusative singular of Poulos Chara which could be translated much happiness. Paul possesses a happiness of a mature believer plus his happiness which overflows due to his contact with other mature Christians. 

Consolation is the accusative singular of the noun Paraklesis which means encouragement

‘Because the bowels of the saints’ is Hote plus Splagchnon is better translated tender affection of the saints.

Refreshed is the aorist passive indicative of Anapauo which means have been refreshed with the passive voice indication receiving of refreshment. 

Philemon, the mature believer has been a great refreshment to all he meets, even his slaves.

‘By thee” is Dia plus the genitive of the pronoun Su which means through you.

He addresses Philemon by the word Adelphoi as he is taking up a family matter and is not going to use his rank of apostleship.

Translation – For I have come to much happiness and encouragement by your love for God because the tender affections of believers has been refreshed through you brother.

Onesimus is about to appear and this is going to test the maturity of Philemon. The ministry of refreshment is likely to be challenged.

Under Roman law because of what Onesimus has done Philemon has the right to torture his slave, brand him or even kill him. He legally is able to do this however he will not have a spirit of refreshment if he follows this legal path.

Application
~~~~~~~~~~~

*verse 4* It is to God’s glory that people reach maturity and they have a mutual respect.

We are to love the brethren, we are to have agape type love.

When you are thankful for someone you pray for them. 

*verse 5* Love for the Lord Jesus Christ and the brethren is the ultimate of maturity in our spiritual life. `1 John 4:20,21,  James 2:8`

If you are occupied with the person of the Lord Jesus Christ you are not going to be too concerned about what believers are doing or not doing or what their attitude is towards you is but you should be concerned for them.

Maturity results in stability towards others and agape love towards them. 

*verse 6* The doctrine in the Bible must be absorbed by you and turned into working knowledge.

The life of Philemon was a testimony. “Every good thing” was the result of the fact that “  it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure – `Philippians 2:13`

*verse 7* Do you by your Christian life give happiness to those about you?

If people come into contact with you are they refreshed?

This is a grace crisis and is the purpose of the epistle. The principle is that a person who is 100% right can do the right thing but lose the refreshing of others by doing the right thing but not the best thing. 

Can Philemon avoid the pitfalls of legalism and operate on grace? 

If you choose legalism you can become self righteous and cast a pall of gloom wherever you go. 

If you choose grace you can be refreshing to others. 

The principle here is that I would rather choose grace than be “right” according to the law.
