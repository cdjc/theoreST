The Apostolic Greeting - Salutation to the Body of Christ
---------------------------------------------------------

.. biblepassage:: Philemon 1:1-3

Analysis and Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In verse 1 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ shows that Paul who is an apostle is not going to claim rank over a mature believer in Philemon. This is going to allow Philemon to act on the basis of his own unhindered free will in relation to Onesimus. 

Paul approaches him as a fellow ambassador not as an apostle. This means that he will approach him on the basis of equality. He approaches him as a friend. This is a personal letter to a personal friend.

He is not a prisoner of Nero, he is a prisoner of Jesus Christ. While he is in prison he is innocent and will die as an innocent man. Yet Paul in verse 13 advocates capital punishment. Both the Lord Jesus Christ and Paul died as innocent people by capital punishment but both advocated it.

Timothy called “our brother” should be “the brother”. He is brother to all Christians.

By calling Philemon our dearly beloved Paul confirms that what Philemon is doing is effective. In these verses we see different people addressed in different ways showing different works in the body of Christ. Here we see the wife and son of Philemon addressed and it is further expanded to the entire church at Colossi.

The Colossian church is facing two problems. One is Gnosticism which is dealt with in the epistle to the Colossians, the other is slavery which he addresses in this letter.
