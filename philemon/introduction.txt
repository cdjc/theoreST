Introduction
------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

This letter was written together with Ephesians, Philippians and Colossians during Paul’s
first Roman imprisonment. Its position in the Bible was chosen by the Church Fathers who saw
that it was like Timothy and Titus, a letter to an individual, rather than an epistle to a
corporate group as were `Mark 3:10-14,16` the other :verse:`Mark 3:16` prison epistles. :RFC:`2822`

Background
----------

Geographical
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Philemon lived in a city called Colossae which was in modern day Asiatic Turkey in the
Phrygian country called Anatolia.

There is no city there today, just the ruins but it was a great city at the time of Paul. A
companion epistle was written to the church at Colossae, the epistle to the Colossians.

The Main Players
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Philemon
........

Philemon was a very rich man who had come to a saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. He
apparently had come down to Ephesus and listened to Paul who spoke daily for two years at
the school of Tyrannus.
        
He was a mature Christian for after his conversion under Paul’s ministry he had grown under
the teaching ministry of Paul.
        
He was a long term friend of Paul and a leader of the church at Colossae though not the
pastor.

Onesimus
........

Onesimus was the slave of Philemon who robbed his master and fled to Rome. His idea was to
become lost in the huge population of Rome and therefore evade recapture.
        
In some wonderful way Onesimus’ path crossed that of Paul resulting in his conversion to
the Lord Jesus Christ.
        
Onesimus becomes a servant of Paul as well as growing under his teaching becoming a mature
believer.
        
Paul knew that under Roman law Onesimus must be returned to his master and to clarify and
assist in this rather difficult situation he writes a letter to Philemon.
        
Onesimus returns to Philemon in company with the pastors of the Ephesian and Colossian
churches who are also taking letters from Paul back to their respective churches.
        
Paul asks in a very gracious manner that Philemon take Onesimus back, not as a free man but
a servant who is a brother in Christ.
        
Here we have a free man addressing a brother who is a slave owner about another brother who
is a slave. Paul also asks Philemon to prepare a room for his future visit which must have
given Onesimus additional comfort.
        
Paul
....

The great apostle in chains in prison in Rome is able to give Philemon, who he sees as
completely in the right, guidance as to how to tackle this problem in the best way.
        
Paul had had experience in this area with his rejection of John Mark for the second
missionary journey after Mark had deserted Paul on the first.
        
Paul is also looking forward to his release and going to meet up with his friend Philemon
in the future.
        
This epistle demonstrates that letter writing can be a ministry from God if we allow it to
be so.  A person who finds it difficult to speak sometimes finds writing a better way.
        
Slavery
~~~~~~~

Slavery was a great evil in the ancient world but it was also part of the 
ancient world. If there is anywhere in the Bible where you would expect a
social manifesto regarding the abolition of slavery it would have been here.

There were approximately sixty million slaves in the Roman Empire which 
represented about half of the population. If they had revolted en masse 
the Roman Empire would have fallen overnight.

Under Roman law a run away slave could be beaten to death or killed any
way the master wanted to or he could be pardoned. Paul is sticking to the
letter of the law.

The Romans had a law that if a slave killed his master and was protected
by other slaves in the household all the slaves would be killed.
At the time of writing this the Senate was debating a case where a
very cruel master had been killed by a slave and protected by his fellow
slaves. After days of debate all the 300 slaves were killed, 
men women and children.

Slavery was therefore a very important social issue in Paul’s day not 
unlike apartheid in recent times.

    Something about apartheid here

It is of note that one thing Paul does not do is to ask Philemon to set 
the slaves free. Paul is working from within the institution to humanise 
it from within. From a Scriptural viewpoint slavery is dealt with in
