                 do not forget my teaching,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                but let your heart keep
                 my commandments,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                2 
                 for they will provide

        <line_block>
            <line>
                and they will add well-being

        <line_block>
            <line>
                3 
                 Do not let truth and mercy
                 leave you;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                bind them around your neck,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                write them on the tablet of your heart.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                4

                    Lord
                 with all your heart,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and do not rely
                 on your own understanding.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                6 
                 Acknowledge
                 him in all your ways,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and he will make your paths straight.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                7 
                 Do not be wise in your own estimation;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                fear the 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord
                 and turn away from evil.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                8 
                 This will bring
                 healing to your body,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and refreshment
                 to your inner self.

            <line>
                9 
                 Honor
                 the 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord
                 from your wealth
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and from the first fruits of all your crops;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                10 
                 then your barns will be filled completely,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and your vats
                 will overflow
                 with new wine.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                11 
                 My child, do not despise discipline from the 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and do not loathe
                 his rebuke.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                12 
                 For the 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord
                 disciplines
                 those he loves,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                just as a father
                 disciplines
                 the son in whom he delights.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                13 
                 Blessed
                 is the one
                 who finds
                 wisdom,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and the one who obtains
                 understanding.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                14 
                 For her
                 benefit
                 is more profitable
                 than silver,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and her
                 gain
                 is better
                 than gold.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                15 
                 She is more precious than rubies,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and none of the things
                 you desire
                 can compare
                 with her.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                16 
                 Long life
                 is in her right hand;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                in her left hand are riches and honor.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                17 
                 Her ways are very pleasant,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and all her paths are peaceful.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                18 
                 She is like
                 a tree of life
                 to those who obtain her,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and everyone who grasps hold of her will be blessed.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                19 
                 By wisdom the 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord
                 laid the foundation of the earth;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                he established the heavens by understanding.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                20 
                 By his knowledge the primordial sea
                 was broken open,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and the clouds drip down dew.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                21 
                 My child, do not let them
                 escape from your sight;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                safeguard sound wisdom and discretion.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                22 
                 So
                 they will give
                 life to you,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and grace to adorn
                 your neck.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                23 
                 Then you will walk on your way
                 with security,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and you
                 will not stumble.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                24 
                 When
                 you lie down you will not be filled with fear;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                when
                 you lie down your sleep will be pleasant.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                25 
                 You will not be afraid
                 of sudden
                 disaster,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                or when destruction overtakes
                 the wicked;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                26 
                 for the 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord
                 will be
                 the source of your confidence,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and he will guard your foot
                 from being caught in a trap.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                27 
                 Do not withhold good from those who need it,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                when
                 you
                 have the ability
                 to help.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                28 
                 Do not say to your neighbor, “Go! Return tomorrow
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and I will give it,” when
                 you have it with you at the time.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                29 
                 Do not plot
                 evil against your neighbor
        <line_block>
            <line>
                when
                 he dwells by you unsuspectingly.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                30 
                 Do not accuse
                 anyone
                 without legitimate cause,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                if he has not treated you wrongly.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                31 
                 Do not envy a violent man,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                and do not choose to imitate
                 any of his ways;
        <line_block>
            <line>
                32 
                 for one who goes astray
                 is an abomination
                 to the 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                but he reveals
                 his intimate counsel
                 to the upright. 
        <line_block>
            <line>
                33 
                 The 
                <emphasis>
                    Lord
                ’s curse
                 is on the household
                 of the wicked,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                but he blesses
                 the home
                 of the righteous.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                34 
                 Although
                 he is scornful to arrogant scoffers,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                yet
                 he shows favor to the humble.
        <line_block>
            <line>
                35 
                 The wise inherit honor,
        <line_block>
            <line>
                but he holds fools up
                 to public contempt.
