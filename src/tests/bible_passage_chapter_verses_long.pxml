                 The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples. 
                3 
                 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king’s business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. 
                4 
                 Mordecai was of high rank
                 in the king’s palace, and word about him was spreading throughout all the provinces. His influence
                 continued to become greater and greater.

                 The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, bringing death and destruction, and they did as they pleased with their enemies. 
                6 
                 In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
