Core process
------------

Greek role for greek words. Hypertext link to online greek dictionary. Or mark so that can be hyperlinked later.

Versioning

Translation: Interaction with versioning. Automatic via online translation provider. Pass through greek words as is (also, consider non-latin target alphabet)

DONE: LaTeX: biblepassage footnotes should be directly under the passage, not at the bottom of the page

DONE: LaTeX: Use rubber to auto-rerun until references are correct

DONE: Draft comments

Smallcaps LORD in included biblical passages

verse parser to check chapters and verses are within bounds

Non-latin languages from biblegateway.com

biblepassage directive to have option to exclude verse numbers.

DONE: Fix biblepassage footnotes. See Philemon 1:8-21.

Fix references to whole chapters (currently just points to first verse)

Citations and bibliography. ``sphinxcontrib.bibtex`` exists, but is not yet suitable: citations are limited to [1] format based on upstream pybtex restrictions.

Editing
-------

Remove KJV-isms. Useful to ease automatic translations.

Create style guide: Conventions used etc. "What the rst should look like". 

Pre-existing Bugs
