Evangelism
~~~~~~~~~~

1. All believers are ambassadors for Christ, and are obliged to give the give the gospel to unbelievers. (`Acts 1:8, 2 Timothy 4:5`)

#. Two forms of witnessing - with the lips (`2 Corinthians 5:18-21` and by the life (`2 Corinthians 3:3`).

#. The gospel is "good news".

#. Sin is not an issue. Jesus died for all sin on the cross. The penalty has been paid. The issue now is "Do you trust that Jesus Christ has died for your sins, and was raised from the dead to give life to all who believe on Him?" People choose to either rely upon Jesus Christ, or upon their own good works, to be saved (`Romans 8:1, 9:30-33`).

#. What about the heathen who haven't heard?

   a. God is totally fair, and everyone has the chance to be saved.

   #. Unlimited Atonement (`Colossians 2:14,15`).

   #. God's will - none should perish (`2 Peter 3:9`).

   #. Man's negative will - God consciousness - Gospel hearing.


#. Witnessing is impossible except through the power of the Holy Spirit. (`John 16:8-13`) The Holy Spirit convicts of

   a. Sin because of unbelief.

   #. Righteousness.

   #. Judgment because of Satan being judged (`Matthew 25:41`).


#. The natural man needs the Holy Spirit to understand the gospel (`1 Corinthians 2:14`).

#. The Bible is the weapon of witnessing (`1 Corinthians 15:3, 4`).

#. Biblical Pattern of Witnessing (`1 Thessalonians 2:1-12`)

   a. Effective contact (`v1|1 Thessalonians 2:1`)

   #. The gospel must be given even under opposition (`v2|1 Thessalonians 2:2`)

   #. The gospel must never be compromised or watered down (`v3|1 Thessalonians 2:3`)

   #. The believer in whom the gospel is deposited is tested by God and should not be for the praise of man (`v4|1 Thessalonians 2:4`)

   #. Flattery should never be part of the gospel (`v5-6|1 Thessalonians 2:5-6`)

   #. Whilst the gospel should not be given to get praise from men it should be given in love without cost (`v9|1 Thessalonians 2:9`)

   #. The gospel must be followed up (`v10|1 Thessalonians 2:10`) with discipleship and teaching (`v11|1 Thessalonians 2:11`) so that the new believer can become spiritually self-reliant (`v10-12|1 Thessalonians 2:10-12`).


#. Your obligation to witness (`Romans 1:14-16`): you are a debtor (v14), you are ready (v15), you are not ashamed (v16)

#. Win souls, not arguments. Stay on the gospel, don't get side-tracked.

#. We are fishers of men (`Matthew 4:19`)

   a. Fishermen need to be equipped to fish. You need to be walking in the Spirit and you need to know the gospel.

   #. Fishermen go to where the fish are. You must be in contact with unbelievers so that you can witness to them.

   #. Fishermen are patient. Allow for the conviction and preparation of the Holy Spirit in the life of the unbeliever.

   #. Fishermen know what bait to use for different fish. You have to be flexible and know how to approach different personalities.

   #. Fishermen concentrate on fish and not the fishpond. Our primary concern is saving people - the evil in the world will continue to exist.
