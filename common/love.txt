   #. *agape* (concerned love for others, great esteem for the loved one, reverence, a love that springs from adoration and veneration, and is a love of the will that chooses the loved one and devotes self to them to the exclusion of lesser objects. It may mean a self denying and compassionate devotion to the loved one)

#. Our Lord makes it clear to Peter in `John 21: 15-19` that he wants Peter to love him with agape love that flows from a deep occupation with the Lord. Agape, as a love of the will, must work out in service of the Lord, and this will express the believers love (agape) for other believers also.

#. Do not love of the things the world has to offer (`1 John 2:15-17`).

#. True love of God will always lead to love of the brethren (`1 John 1:3 -11, 1 John 3:1-3, 10, 4:7 -12, 19`).

#. Love is expressed in worship and in service (`1 John 5:1-5`).

#. Love for God will flow and grow from knowledge of His word (`1 Corinthians 2:9`).

#. This deep love will be expressed in witness for the Lord to others (`2 Corinthians 5:14`).

#. God loves every believer with perfect and unchanging love because we are united with His beloved Son.
