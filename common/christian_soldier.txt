Soldier:  christian soldier of ephesians chapter 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General scripture `Ephesians 6:11-17`.  This passage relates to the armour which the Roman soldier wore and analogises its use into the spiritual realm.

1. USE OF THE ARMOUR `Ephesians 6:11` "Put on the whole armour of God. " `Ephesians 6:11a` We are instructed to "put on" (ENDUO Gk) - this means "to clothe"- it is a command by God to the Christian soldier.  We are to "clothe ourselves" or to "dress ourselves".

   "Whole armour" (PANOPLIA Gk) - the complete armour "of God" (THEOS Gk) true source of the armour is God.

   The whole armour of God is given in `Ephesians 6:14-17`. It comprises:-

   a. The Belt of Truth  (`Ephesians 6:14a`)

   #. Breastplate of Righteousness  (`Ephesians 6:14b`)

   #. Boots  (`Ephesians 6:15`)

   #. Shield  (`Ephesians 6:16`)

   #. Helmet of Salvation  (`Ephesians 6:17a`)

   #. Sword of the Spirit  (`Ephesians 6:17b`)

   PRINCIPLES:

   a. The Roman soldier wore all his armour for his own safety and protection.

   #. When the Roman soldier was highly disciplined he ruled the world.

   #. When the Roman soldier became degenerate the Empire declined and fell.

   #. The Roman soldier was in the army 7 days a week.

   SPIRITUAL ANALOGY

   a. As Christian soldiers we wear our armour for our own safety and protection.

   #. When we are highly disciplined in the Christian life we are very effective in our warfare.

   #. If we become degenerate or apostate our Christian witness and effectiveness declines and we become casualties in the spiritual warfare.

   #. The Christian soldier is in the battle 7 days a week. A part time soldier never amounts to an effective soldier.





   "That ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil". `Ephesians 6:11b`. "to stand" (HISTEMI (Gk) - to hold your ground. We are in a spiritual warfare and the purpose of the armour is to hold our ground against the foe. "the wiles" (METHODEIA DIA Gk) - tactics, cunning or fraud "of the devil" (DIABOLOS Gk).

   We therefore have the whole armour of God to enable us to stand firm against the devil's tactics.

   PRINCIPLE: By learning the tactics likely to be employed by your opponent the Christian soldier is able to go on the offensive using the sword of the Spirit - the Word of God. (v l7).

#. THE ENEMY (`Ephesians 6:12`)

   a. PRINCIPALITIES (ARCHE Gk) Ruling demons.

   #. POWERS (EXOUSIA Gk) - Demons with authority, officers in the demon army.

   #. RULERS OF THE DARKNESS OF THIS WORLD (KOSMOKRATOR Gk) - world rulers, demons close to the seats of government such as the demons of (`Daniel 10:13, 20`).

   #. SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HIGH PLACES (PNEU MATIKOS PONERIA Gk) - the demon army.


   "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places. "

   "Wrestle" - "the wrestling" (HE PALE ESTIN Gk) hand to hand combat not wrestling as a sport. "not against flesh and blood" - not against other members of the human race, but against:-

   Quite clearly our fight is against a spiritual foe. From `Hebrews 2:7` we know that as human beings we are inferior to angels. Therefore in order to have success against superior forces we must have God's armour.

#. BE PREPARED (`Ephesians 6:13`)

   "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all, to stand. "

   Since the resurrection ascension and session of Jesus Christ the attack of Satan has moved from the line of Christ to the individual believer (see topics 6 and 173). Our dependence on the whole armour is imperative yet many believers reject part or all of the armour. There are many casualties as a consequence.

   We are again exhorted to put on the whole armour of God.

#. THE BELT OF TRUTH (`Ephesians 6:14a, Isaiah 11:5`)

   "Stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth"

   The Roman belt was a wide girdle of leather worn around the waist from which hung the scabbard for the sword and loops for rations and equipment. The leather belt was supported by a cross shoulder strap studded with metal plates with thick leather strips hanging down to protect the lower body. The belt therefore was the basic armour on which the defence of the soldier was based.

   PRINCIPLE: Our basic defence is the truth contained within the Word of God. The sword of the Spirit hangs securely to the believer by means of the promises contained within it. The greater our trust in the truth of God the greater our protection against the enemy.

#. THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS (`Ephesians 6:14b, Isaiah 59:17`)

   "and having on the breastplate of righteousness". The breastplate (THORAX Gk) was usually made of leather overlaid with metal strips. Shaped like a sleeveless coat it was in the higher ranks often covered with gold or silver. The belt held the breastplate firmly in place. Its primary function being to protect every vital area of the soldiers body.

   PRINCIPLE: The righteousness of Christ protects us. We stand in his righteousness alone. He gave us his righteousness at the cross (`2 Corinthians 5:21`). Our continued protection through his righteousness is through the filling of the Holy Spirit (`Ephesians 5:18`).

#. THE BOOTS (`Ephesians 6:15, Isaiah 52:7`)

   "And your feet shod, with the preparation of the gospel of peace".

   The boots (CALIGAE Gk) were made of hobnail studded leather soles 15mm (1/2") thick secured with a leather tie over the instep and round the ankles. Good footwear is essential for the soldier with infantry still being essential even in these days of sophisticated armaments.

   PRINCIPLE: In spiritual terms the feet are often analogised to service. The feet take one towards the enemy. The gospel of peace is a direct attack on the enemy. Peace in this context talks of reconciliation between God and man. (`Romans 1:14-16, 2 Corinthians 5:18-20`).

#. THE SHIELD OF FAITH (`Ephesians 6:16; 1 John 5:4`)

   "Above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. "

   The Roman shield (THUREOS Gk) was shaped like a door being made of glued planks wrapped in canvas or calf skin, the top and bottom edges being protected by iron. The shield was the most active of the defensive armour carried by the Roman soldier. Loss of shield often meant death to the soldier.

   PRINCIPLE: The Christian soldier's shield is walking actively in the promises and principles set out in the Word of God. If we do not use our faith we can become spiritual casualties. Using the shield of faith we can claim the 7,000 promises for the Christian walk including `Isaiah 41:10; 1 Corinthians 10:13; 1 John 4:4`.

#. THE HELMET OF SALVATION (`Ephesians 6:17a; Isaiah 59:17`)

   "And take the Helmet of salvation."

   With the exception of the standard bearer who wore a wolf's head, every Roman soldier wore a metal helmet (PERIK Gk) usually of bronze over an iron skull cap. This protected the most important part of the soldier - his head.

   PRINCIPLE: Before a person can be a soldier for Christ, he has to be born again. He has to wear the helmet of salvation. One of the wiles of the devil is to make the believer feel that he has lost his salvation. (see topic 66). If a believer loses his assurance of salvation he takes his helmet of salvation off and is totally vulnerable to the attack of the foe.

#. THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT (`Ephesians 6:17b`)

   "and the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God.

   The sword referred to is the MACHAIRA or Roman short sword. The sword represents the basic offensive weapon for close combat. It was only effective when out of its sheath.

   PRINCIPLE: The sword in its sheath is potentially devastating but it is only effective when it is used to combat and defeat the enemy. We must therefore conquer using principles, promises and doctrines from the Word of God.
