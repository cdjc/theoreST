The Church
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Greek EKKLESIA (literally "the called out ones")

   a. Citizen Assembly (`Acts 19:32`)

   #. Assembly of Israel (`Acts 7:38`)

   #. Synagogue (`Matthew 18:17`)

   #. Body of Christ (all believers) (`Ephesians 1:22,23, 5:25-7, Colossians 1:18`)


   This word is used four different ways in scripture:

#. The church is said to be a mystery (`Ephesians 3:1-6, Colossians 1:25,26, Romans 16:25,26`). Mystery - something that was hidden in the past in the Old Testament period but is now revealed.

#. The Church began at Pentecost 32 AD (Acts 2) and will be removed from the earth at the Rapture (1Thessalonians 4:17)

#. Believers in the Church Age are unique, having spiritual blessings which did not exist in the Old Testament.

   a. Every believer is united with Christ, in the Body of Christ.

   #. Jesus Christ indwells every believer.

   #. The Holy Spirit indwells every believer.

   #. Every believer is a priest, praying and serving directly to God.

   #. We have a completed canon of scripture.

   #. Believers are commanded to live by the Spirit, not by Law.

   #. Every believer is an ambassador of Christ.


#. The Church is different to Israel.

   a. The Jews started with Abraham (`Genesis 12:1-3`).  The Church started at Pentecost (Acts 2; `Galatians 3:26-28`).

   #. Israel was promised blessings on earth (`Deuteronomy 28:1-14`).  The Church is promised blessings in heavenly places (`Ephesians 1:3; Hebrews 3:1`).

   #. Israel's relationship to God was based on a Covenant (`Genesis 17:7,8`).  The Church's relationship to God is based on new birth (`John 1:12,13; 1` Peter 1:23).

   #. Israel's prophecy is mainly in the Old Testament.  Prophecy of the Church is only in the New Testament.

   #. Israel worshipped at Jerusalem (`Psalm 122:1-4`).  The Church worships where two or three are gathered together in Christ's name (`Matthew 18:20`).

   #. Israel lived under the law (`Ezekiel 20:10-12`).  The Church is under grace (`John 1:17; Romans 6:14`).

   #. Israel's destiny is with Palestine (`Isaiah 60:18-21`).  The Church will be removed from the earth (1Thessalonians 4:13-18).

   #. Christ is King and Messiah to Israel.  Christ is Head and Bridegroom to the Church.

   #. Israel contained Jews only.  The Church is made up of both Jews and Gentiles.
