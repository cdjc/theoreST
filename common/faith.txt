Faith
~~~~~

1. The Christian life can be divided into three sections or stages:

   a. Stage 1 - Salvation.

   #. Stage 2 - The Christian Walk

   #. Stage 3 - The Christian in Heaven.


#. Man has three means of obtaining knowledge:

   a. Faith - to believe or trust that something is true

   #. Reasoning - using human logic to deduce that something is true

   #. Experimentation - to test and prove something to satisfy yourself that it is true


#. The only acceptable method of gaining grace is by faith, since this means depending upon God without our human merit.

   a. Stage 1 - Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved - salvation (`Acts 16:31`).

   #. Stage 2 - Trusting in the promises and principles of the Word of God - the Christian walk.

   #. Stage 3 - Trusting in God's provision - Heaven.


#. Salvation faith is the complete trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, who died for your sins and rose from the dead to give you eternal life (`Romans 4:20-25`).

#. Anything added to becomes works, and therefore nullifies faith (`Romans 4:4`).

#. Faith is shown outwardly by confession with the mouth (`Romans 10:9-10`).

#. Since faith does not depend on our own abilities, anybody can believe. Even little children (`Matthew 18:2-4`).

#. Assurance is by faith (`Hebrews 10:22`).

#. Overcoming by faith:

   a. The heroes of faith are illustrated for our encouragement in `Hebrews 11:1-39`.

   #. By faith learn to accept conditions as God's will for life and be thankful - `Romans 8:28, 1 Thessalonians 3:3; 5:18`

   #. By faith maintain fellowship with God, walking in the light - `1 John 1:7`

   #. By faith consistently day by day examine your conduct, confessing all known sins - `1 Corinthians 11:28, 31, 1 John 1:9`

   #. By faith receive the Word of God daily - `Matthew 4:4; 5:6, 2 Peter 3:18`

   #. By faith pray, casting every care on Him - `Hebrews 4:15,16; 1 Peter 5:7`

   #. By faith resist the attempts of Satan and he will flee from you - `Ephesians 6:10-13, 1 Peter 5:8`

   #. By faith meditate on spiritual values and priorities - `Philippians 4:6-9`

   #. Walk by faith and not by sight - `2 Corinthians 5:7`
