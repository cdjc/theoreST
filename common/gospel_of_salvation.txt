Gospel of Salvation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Gospel means "good news" - four types of gospel are found in the New Testament.

#. Gospel of the Kingdom.

   a. Preached by John the Baptist (`Matthew 3:1, 2`), the Lord Jesus Christ (`Matthew 4:23`) and his disciples (`Matthew 10:7`) Thy Kingdom come (`Matthew 6:10`).

   #. It consists of the setting up on earth of Christ's 1,000 year Kingdom thus fulfilling the Davidic Covenant (`2 Samuel 7:16`)

   #. There will be another preaching of the gospel by the Jewish remnant in the days of the Great Tribulation before the 2nd Advent (`Matthew 24:14, Revelation 7`). After the 2nd Advent the 1,000 year reign commences (`Revelation 20:1-6`).

#. Gospel of Grace - the gospel of personal salvation by grace through faith. This gospel appears under many names and is the means of salvation throughout the history of mankind.

   a. Gospel of God (`Romans 1:1, 1 Thessalonians 2:2`)

   #. Gospel of Christ (`Mark 1:1, Romans 1:16`)

   #. Gospel of the Grace of God (`Acts 20:24`)

   #. Gospel of Peace (`Ephesians 6:15`)

   #. Gospel of your salvation (`Ephesians 1:13`)

   #. Glorious Gospel (`2 Corinthians 4:4`)


#. The Everlasting Gospel - (`Revelation 14:6`) - the good news is everlasting. This gospel will be preached on earth just before Christ's return in glory (`Matthew 25:31, 32`). This gospel is the means of salvation to countless thousands both Jews and Gentiles (`Revelation 7:9-14`).

#. Paul's "My Gospel" - (`Romans 2:16`) This is the same gospel of salvation by grace through faith but includes the mystery doctrines of the church age not previously revealed. The gospel in the Old Testament was revealed by the Tabernacle, Feasts, Levitical Offerings etc.

#. Another Gospel" which is not another (`Galatians 1:6, 7, 2 Corinthians 11:4`) This is a perversion of the Gospel of Christ (`Galatians 1:8, 9`) The curse is proclaimed on any who preach it. There have been many perversions - legalism in Galatia, angel worship in Colossae (`Colossians 2:18`) among others.
