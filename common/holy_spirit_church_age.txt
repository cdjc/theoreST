Holy spirit: Â ministry of the holy spirit in the church age
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. TO THE UNBELIEVER

   a. RESTRAINING (`2 Thessalonians 2:7`) If unbelievers were unrestrained in the Church Age the one world system which Satan is trying to establish would come.  After the rapture of the Church it will come.
   
   b. CONVICTING (`John 16:7-11`)
   
      i. Sin - the barrier which remains in unbelief.
      
      #. Righteousness - God is totally righteous, man is only relatively righteous and needs God's righteousness for salvation.
      
      #. Judgment - Satan and all unbelievers are judged.
      
   c. REGENERATION (`John 3:5`) Man without the spirit cannot understand spiritual things.  The Gospel is spiritual, the Holy Spirit makes the gospel a reality to the unbeliever when one believes and is "born again" or regenerated. (`1 Corinthians 2:14`)


#. TO THE BELIEVER AT SALVATION

   a. REGENERATION (`John 3:1-16, Titus 3:5`)

   #. BAPTISM (`Acts 1:5, 1 Corinthians 12:13, Ephesians 4:5`) We are baptized into union with Jesus Christ and become part of the body of Christ.

   #. INDWELLING (`Romans 8:9, 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20`) From salvation on the believer is indwelt by the Spirit.

   #. SEALING (`2 Corinthians 1:22, Ephesians 1:13, 4:30`). This ministry relates to your future with God, the guarantee of eternal security.

   #. DISTRIBUTION OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS (`1 Corinthians 12:11`) Each believer receives a spiritual gift at the point of salvation in order to function in the body of Christ.


#. TO THE BELIEVER AFTER SALVATION (Spirituality)

   The Ministry of the Holy Spirit after salvation is the means by which we live the type of Christian life that God has designed for us (`Ephesians 5: 1-8`)

   WHO CONTROLS YOUR LIFE - THE HOLY SPIRIT OR THE OLD SIN NATURE?

   a. Spirituality and Carnality (`1 John 3:4-9`) You are either one or the other never partially both.

   #. Spirituality lost through sin; recovered through confession of sin. (`Proverbs 1:23, 1 John 1:9`)

   #. When we are controlled by the Holy Spirit we are not under the Mosaic Law. (`Romans 8:2-4, 10:4, 13:8, Galatians 5:18`)

   #. The character of Jesus Christ is produced by the believer when he is filled with the Spirit. (`Galatians 4:19, 5:22, 23`)

   #. Spirituality does not depend on emotion, ecstatics or feelings (`2 Corinthians 6:11, 12`)

   #. General objectives of being filled with the Spirit:

      i. Partnership with God (`2 Peter 1:4`)

      #. Imitation of God (`Ephesians 5: 1`)

      #. Glorification of Christ (`John 7:39, 16:14, 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20`)

      #. Fulfillment of the Law (`Romans 8:2-4`)
