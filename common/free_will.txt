Free will
~~~~~~~~~

1. Free will is the responsibility before God to choose a course of action.

#. God gave Adam choice in the garden (`Genesis 2:16-17`).

#. Free will exists in both believer and unbeliever (`John 7:17`).

#. In Christianity free will cannot be coerced - it is a matter of obedience (`2 Corinthians 5:10`).

#. Man is responsible for his actions, and must give an account to God (`Revelation 20:11-15`).

#. Because man is subject to judgment there is an age at which children become accountable before God for their actions.

#. Three problems which the Bible solves regarding free will:

   a. What about babies who die before they hear the gospel or those who are mentally not able to decide?

   Solution - (`2 Samuel 12:18`) where a child born to David and Bathsheba dies on the 7th day, the day before circumcision which would have brought the child into a covenant relationship. David says that he will go to be with the child indicating the child has been automatically saved without a covenant requirement.

   #. What about the physical damage which hinders the person causing a restriction of free will ?

   Solution - (`John 9:1-7`) where a man blind from birth is healed. Jesus did not bypass the free will but made up for the blindness. He breaks down the barriers for a person to do God's will but the free will of the person is not manipulated.

   #. What about spiritual damage to free will ?

   Solution - (`Genesis 3:8`) where after the fall God sought out Adam and Eve in the garden where they had hidden from him. God will seek out all men and give them the opportunity of salvation.

#. It is possible to harden your heart that it becomes impossible to believe or repent. Examples in Scripture:

   a. the Amorites and Canaanites of Joshua's day (`Genesis 15:16`)

   #. the Pharaoh of the Exodus (Exodus 7- 11 [TODO: chapter range references])

   #. those who choose to worship the creation rather than the Creator (`Romans 1:1-32`)

   #. those who accept the mark of the beast (`Revelation 13:8`)

   #. the reaction of unbelievers at the Second Advent (`Revelation 6:16`).


#. The person who desires to know God will find Him (`John 7:17`).

#. If God is truly sovereign how can man have genuine free choice?

   In eternity past, God foreknew every decision and event which would occur in all creation. He worked all things to work together to achieve His sovereign purpose. God uses His sovereign will as planner and creator, man uses his free will as a part of the creation.

   a. Paul as a prisoner on a ship bound for Rome predicts, having received advice from the angel of God, that there will be no loss of life but the ship will become a wreck. The guarantee is a sovereign guarantee and therefore absolute. Paul however tells the soldiers that they must stay on the boat to be saved. They do and they are saved. Sovereign decrees by God therefore contain free will decisions by man (`Acts 27`).

   #. The sovereign decree is that all things work together for good towards the goal of predestination and eventual glorification. We have a guarantee that we will be in heaven. Yet we continually make free will decisions in the process (`Romans 8:28`).

   #. Daniel understood the time of "desolations" as seventy years as prophesied by Jeremiah and knew that it would end on time. He now seeks by supplication with sackcloth and ashes forgiveness for Israel's sin on the basis that no discipline is going to be removed without the sin having been forgiven (`Daniel 9:2`).

#. Free will can never be neutral - you are either obedient or disobedient to God (`Isaiah 55:7-9`).
