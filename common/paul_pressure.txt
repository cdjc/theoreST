Paul – Pressure 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. SCRIPTURE -         Acts, Epistles.

#. BIOGRAPHY

   Paul, whose name means "little", was born Saul ("asked for") in Tarsus, Cilicia (`Acts 9:11; 21:39; 22:3`). His family probably was fairly wealthy and influential as this was a requirement for Roman citizenship of foreigners (`Acts 16:37`). Jewish law required a boy to start studying the scriptures at five years of age, with him taking on the full obligation of the law at 13.

   Paul had a married sister (`Acts 23:16`), with whom he may have stayed during his studies in Jerusalem under Gamaliel (`Acts 22:3`). He was one of the chief persecutors of the early church and was responsible for the martyrdom of Stephen and the movement of Philip to Samaria.

   Converted on the road to Damascus, Paul, who is the greatest sinner who ever lived (`1 Timothy 1:15`) spent many years preparing himself for his ministry. He was unmarried (`1 Corinthians 7:8`) and was the apostle to the Gentiles. He was the last apostle. Famous for his four missionary journeys and responsible for the writing of much of the New Testament, Saul the persecutor became Paul the great believer. Paul was not a striking person to look upon, being reported as "a man of small stature with a bald head and crooked legs with eyebrows meeting, and nose somewhat hooked but full of friendliness". Paul eventually was imprisoned for a final time in Rome where he was beheaded by Nero in AD 67.

#. PRINCIPLES

   a. Pressure can come from your closest colleagues (such as Peter), your family or countrymen (the Jews), religious or political leaders (the high priest) (`Matthew 10:35,36`).

   #. Pressure can be applied by circumstances (`Psalm 46:1-5`).

   #. We are in Satan's world. If we are effective we will be opposed (`Ephesians 6:12`).

   #. Religion is antagonistic to Christianity (`Romans 3:27,28`).

   #. You will be attacked if you downgrade people's idols, be they physical or mental (`Judges 6:30`).

   #. The Lord can divinely protect believers (`Psalm 124:1-5`).

   #. The purpose of testing or pressure is to build up faith and to keep down pride (`Romans 5:3,4`).

   #. There is inner happiness for those who are persecuted for the Lord's sake (`Luke 6:22,23`).

   #. All things work together for good to the believer (`Romans 8:28`).
