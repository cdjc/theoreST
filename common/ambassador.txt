Ambassador
~~~~~~~~~~

1. An Ambassador does not appoint himself, he is appointed by the nation he represents, the king he represents, the person he represents. We are appointed by God (`2 Corinthians 5:20`).

#. An Ambassador does not support himself. We are in the plan of God and are sustained and protected by him (`Ephesians 5:18`).

#. An Ambassador does not represent himself. We represent God on earth (`Matthew 28:19, 20`).

#. An Ambassador does not belong to the nation to which he is sent. Positionally we are in heaven, experientially we are in the Devil's world (`John 15:19`).

#. All Ambassadors have instructions in written form. We have the Word of God (`1 Corinthians 2:16`).

#. An Ambassador representing his country does not treat any insult as personal (`Matthew 5:11, 12`).

#. When an Ambassador is recalled from a country it is tantamount to declaration of war. After the Rapture there will be massive warfare on earth. All the Ambassadors will be recalled at the Rapture (`1 Thessalonians 4:13-17`)
