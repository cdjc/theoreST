Positional Truth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Positional truth is union with Christ at the right hand of the Father.

1. Positional truth is one of five ministries of the Holy Spirit which occur at salvation:

   a. Regeneration (`John 3:1-16; Titus 3:5`)

   #. Sealing (`2 Corinthians 1:22; Ephesians 1:13; 4:30`)

   #. Indwelling (`John 7:37-39; Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 6:19,20`)

   #. Baptism (`1 Corinthians 12:13`)

   #. Spiritual gifts (`1 Corinthians 12:11`).


#. The baptism of the Spirit is the mechanics of positional truth. (`Acts 1:5; 1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 4:5`) The Holy Spirit places the believer in union with Christ.

#. Positional truth belongs to the carnal as well as the spiritual believer, to the apostate believer as well as to the mature believer (`1 Corinthians 1:2, 30`).

#. Positional truth protects the believer from divine judgment in eternity (`Romans 8:1`).

#. Positional truth qualifies the believer to live with God forever:

   a. Eternal life (`1 John 5:11,12`)

   #. Imputation of God's righteousness (`2 Corinthians 5:21`).


#. Positional truth is the key to both election and predestination (`Ephesians 1:3-6`).

#. Positional truth creates a new creature (`2 Corinthians 5:1; Ephesians 2:10`) based on who and what Christ is, therefore what grace accomplishes - not what changes we make - at salvation or thereafter.

#. Positional truth guarantees the eternal security of the believer (`Romans 8:38,39`).

#. Positional truth is classified under two categories:

   a. Retroactive - identification with Christ in His death (`Romans 6; Colossians 2:12; 3:3`)

   #. Current - identification with Christ in His victory, resurrection, ascension, session.


#. Current positional truth implies that the believer shares certain things in union with Christ:

   a. Eternal life (`1 John 5:11,12`)

   #. Righteousness of God (`2 Corinthians 5:21`)

   #. Election (`Ephesians 1:4`)

   #. Destiny (`Ephesians 1:5`)

   #. Sonship (`John 1:12; 1 John 3:1,2`)

   #. Heirship (`Romans 8:16,17`)

   #. Sanctification (`1 Corinthians 1:2,30`)

   #. Kingdom (`2 Peter 1:11`)

   #. Priesthood (`Hebrews 10:10-14; 1 Peter 2:5,9`).


#. The characteristics of positional truth are six-fold:

   a. It is not an experience - neither emotional nor ecstatic.

   #. It is not progressive - cannot be improved in time or eternity.

   #. It is not related to human merit, ability, or human good. Here are the implications of retroactive positional truth. There is no place in the plan of God for human good.

   #. It is eternal in nature, it cannot be changed by God, angels or mankind.

   #. It is known only through the Word of God.

   #. It is obtained in total at the point of salvation.
